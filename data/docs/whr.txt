About the AuthorINTRODUCTIONWHY WE BELIEVE
Human beings are primed for belief in the existence of the divine or supernatural. Nothing makes this more apparent than having a simple conversation with a child. For instance, in the late 1990s, Deborah Kelemen, PhD, director of the Child Cognition Laboratory at Boston University, performed a study on teleological thinking in children. Philosophically speaking, teleology
 is the explanation of natural or material things in terms of their apparent purpose and design. Human beings display teleological behavior: We open a book to read it. That’s purpose. Inanimate objects have teleological characteristics: A coffee mug has a handle to help a person hold it. That’s design.
Kelemen found that children don’t just see purpose in human behavior or design in material objects; they also see purpose and design in the natural world. In the study, she pointed to various objects and asked, “What is this for?” With regard to a cloud, the subjects—four- and five-year-old boys and girls—responded that clouds were “for raining.” Though Kelemen explained that raining is something a cloud does, the subjects insisted that rain is not merely a cloud’s function, but its reason
 for existing.
A group of older subjects—seven- and eight-year-olds—was asked to explain why certain large rocks were pointy. This group also gravitated toward teleological answers, such as “Rocks are pointy so animals won’t sit on them and crush them” and “The jagged edges exist so animals can use them to scratch their backs.” Rocks had design; they had a purpose.
Kelemen ultimately described her subjects as “intuitive theists”—automatically viewing the natural world as the product of a supreme designer. Other recent psychological studies have come to the same conclusions. While specific religious beliefs may be taught to young children, the intuition behind those beliefs exists from a very early age. Children identify their “soul” or 
 “thought life” as distinct from their material bodies. They assume that some form of life after death is simply the way the universe works. And they see purpose and design everywhere. In other words, humans are born believers.
Accident of Evolution, or Divine Gift?
In the very first chapter of his book The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design
 , evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, an outspoken atheist, admits that the world tempts humans to believe. He writes, “Biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose.” The complexity of the world compels the idea that something supernatural was behind it. Dawkins explains away our innate capacity to believe in the divine as an accident of evolution, much like some forms of altruism. For example, the desire to donate money for disaster relief in a distant country doesn’t give us any reproductive advantage. According to the principles of natural selection, it actually makes little sense.
Nevertheless, we have brains that are hardwired to identify purpose and design, and we live in a world that seems to suggest the existence of something beyond it. These two truths may form the core of why religion exists. The religious explain our inherent belief as a central feature of human design. The Torah says, “So God created humankind in his own image” (Genesis 1:27, Complete Jewish Bible). The Old Testament teaches that God “has set eternity in the human heart” (Ecclesiastes 3:11, New International Version). And the Quran states, “Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return” (2:156).
Regardless of where it originated, belief is ingrained in the human experience. It provides purpose. It explains the world around us. It soothes our fear of death. It sets parameters for our moral behavior and promises us justice when those boundaries are broken. That’s why
 we believe. The purpose and design of this book is to explain what
 we believe.
What Is Religion?
Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, and others believe humanity is connected to something eternal—an ultimate reality. The world’s religious systems reflect humanity’s attempts to understand and relate to that reality. For this reason, a religion is more than just belief in a deity or a supernatural realm, and it is more than just the existence of sacred scriptures or places of worship.
So, what is religion?
Scholars throughout history have suggested a few essential elements: First, a religion contains some kind of structured belief system, whether those beliefs are related to supernatural beings or interpersonal behavior. Second, it requires certain actions of its adherents, which may include rituals of worship, individual pious deeds, or 
 certain types of conduct within a community. And third, it addresses the great uncertainties of human existence. What is the meaning of life? What is the nature of the universe? Why do we suffer? What happens after we die?
These fundamentals apply equally to newer monotheistic religions like the Bahá’í Faith, ancient polytheistic systems like Hinduism, and even the nontheistic teachings of Taoists and Jains. However, although the world’s religious beliefs may pursue the same ultimate goal, that beginning is where many of the similarities end.
Contradictory Trimmings
“Religion is like the fashion,” wrote English philosopher John Selden in the early 1600s. “One man wears his doublet slashed, another laced, another plain, but every man has a doublet. So every man has a religion. We differ about trimming.” And just like fashion differs across cultures and historical periods, the trimmings of religion are diverse. While most world religions have some version of the “Golden Rule”—Do unto others as you’d have them do unto you
 (Christianity); That which you want for yourself, seek for mankind
 (Islam); Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful
 (Buddhism)—the differences outweigh the similarities. The world’s great religions make exclusive and contradictory claims about truth. Here are just a few:
■
 The monotheistic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam insist there is only one true God. Hinduism posits hundreds, thousands, or even millions of gods and goddesses. Buddhists and Jains don’t believe in a supreme deity at all.
■ Protestant Christianity teaches that a soul’s salvation from sin comes through faith alone in Jesus Christ. Buddhism rejects the idea of an eternal soul and barely acknowledges the need for salvation. If it arrives, salvation comes from within.
■
 Muslims submit to the will of Allah to avoid eternal punishment and find paradise after death. Devout Hindus and Jains don’t believe in a heaven or hell, hoping instead for eventual liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.
■
 Christians, Muslims, and Zoroastrians affirm a supernatural realm filled with good and evil entities. The worldviews of Sikhs and Confucians ignore the supernatural altogether.
■
 Jews and Christians share the same God, the same religious heritage, and some of the same scriptures. But because Jews don’t acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah, many Christians believe they’re destined for hell.
■
 Muslims believe Muhammad was the last in a line of prophets that included Abraham and Jesus, rejecting the faith of Jews and Christians as incomplete.
■
 Many Protestant Christians believe the doctrines of Catholic Christians are unscriptural and may lead them to hell. Catholics believe Protestants are operating outside the true Church and may be bound for punishment in the afterlife.
■
 A Muslim prays five times a day and may make a costly pilgrimage to Mecca because his faith requires it. At the same time, he may believe the Christian tradition of Communion is ridiculous. A Christian may spend hours memorizing and studying the Bible as the authoritative word of God but dismiss the Muslim Quran as nonsense.
These religious differences have led to enormous conflicts over the centuries, which continue today in virtually all parts of the world. Although multiple religious traditions teach the equivalent of the Golden Rule, they don’t always get along. Religion is complicated. To sort out some of the confusion, this book offers an unbiased comparison of the “Big Twelve” religions of the world.
What to Expect from This Book
Before digging into the major twelve religions, part 1
 explores the belief systems of the ancient Egyptians, the ancient Greeks, and the ancient Norse. These religions are commonly identified as “mythology” because they relied on stories to explain society’s values and worldview. Though few people today would insist that gods like Poseidon or Anubis exist, the word myth
 doesn’t necessarily mean “fiction.” These ancient people took their gods seriously—these were legitimate religions, not just collections of legends. However, because these faiths are now obsolete, they’re featured in Ancient Foundations. While reading, keep in mind the witticism of mythologist Joseph Campbell: “Mythology may, in a real sense, be defined as other people’s religion.”
Next, part 2
 explores the teachings and tenets of the world’s twelve most popular and influential religions. Some religions, including Christianity and Islam, are practiced by billions of followers. Others have smaller numbers of adherents but an outsize influence on culture (in the case of Confucianism and Shinto) or the doctrines of other prominent religions (as has been conjectured about Zoroastrianism).
The details of these religions have been arranged into categories in as orderly a fashion as possible to simplify the process of comparison. Timelines, major tenets, major texts, and ceremonial practices are some of the recurring sections for each religion. This is done to present the material in a categorically similar fashion, but it doesn’t mean the individual entries are equivalent in nature. For example, the Five Pillars of Islam are as central to that faith as the Eightfold Path is to Buddhism, but these concepts are quite dissimilar.
And while every effort has been made to provide as much foundational information as possible for each religion, some religions naturally have more information to offer. For example, the list of prominent figures in the history of Christianity is broad, extending from Jesus and St. Paul to Martin Luther and Billy Graham, but a corresponding number of individuals isn’t available for Shintoism or Zoroastrianism. Nevertheless, these categories will enable you to flip through the book to compare all the available information on the various topics covered.
Because this book focuses on the “Big Twelve,” it classifies some religions with worldwide membership, including Latter-day Saints and Jehovah’s Witnesses, under a larger umbrella. Though each of these particular Christian-based religions could easily have a chapter dedicated to it, they are included in the chapter on Christianity—a decision other Christians may find controversial. Likewise, a subject such as “traditional African religions” may categorically apply to millions of practitioners worldwide, but with so many traditions—Vodun/Vodou, Santeria, Yoruba, and Candomblé, to name a few—it is far too diverse to fit within this framework. Additionally, newer religious movements like Cao Dai, Rastafarianism, and Scientology have not yet reached the numbers of the twelve major religions, so they won’t be found here.
The overall tone of this book aims to be descriptive rather than devotional, respecting all religions while remaining as neutral and accurate as possible. This impartial approach may occasionally challenge some readers, but the topic and structure call for it. The only subjective opinions in these pages are those speculating on a religion’s positive and negative influences with regard to society and any suppositions regarding the future of the faith.PART ONE
ANCIENT FOUNDATIONS
New Zealand’s Maori people once believed their island forests came from the god Tane, who lived within the embrace of his parents, the sky god Rangi and the earth goddess Papa. Lacking anyone to embrace on his own, Tane created the first woman from soil and married her. Australia’s Aborigines believed in an ancient period called the Dreaming
 , during which ancestral beings carved the lines of the earth. Known as “songlines,” these creeks and ridges merged at Uluru, the enormous sandstone formation in the heart of the continent. Uluru was thought to house all the spiritual power of their land.
For the indigenous Warao people of Venezuela’s Orinoco Delta, no element held more importance than water. They navigated the life-giving Orinoco in their canoes, but avoided the rough Caribbean waters beyond it. Those waves were home to Hahuba, the two-headed snake of being, believed to create the tides with its constant breathing.
As these ancient people groups interacted with the world around them, they searched for meaning. Unseen forces seemed to be at work, forces that operated outside their control. The weather brought floods, lightning, and powerful winds. Earthquakes shook the ground. Volcanoes bathed the world in ash. Men, women, and children got sick and lost the animating spark of life. Naturally curious, these people asked questions: What caused these circumstances? What spirits animate rivers, waves, and fires? Where did humans come from? And what happens when they die?
The answers arrived in the form of stories, passed between families, communities, and tradespeople, from father to son and mother to daughter. Recounted around the hearth or over a shared meal, the stories told of powerful beings who created the world long ago. These beings animated the rocks, trees, and waters. They created fire and set heavenly bodies in the sky. Their divine battles shook the heavens with thunder. They took departed spirits to a dark underworld and punished humans for failing to show proper respect. From these myths, humans began to make sense not only of their surroundings, but also of their past, present, and future. The stories explained their origins.
Stories about the desires and requirements of the gods began influencing human behavior. Eventually, three of history’s most complex and fully realized systems—Egyptian, Greek, and Norse mythology—arose over centuries of oral tradition. Each borrowed elements from other primitive beliefs to form powerful and fluid religious structures that dominated life within these ancient cultures.
Clearly, there are more stories in the history of world religion than those involving Osiris, Zeus, and Thor. From the epics of the ancient Babylonians to the earliest Chinese folklore to the myths of the Aztecs, Incas, and Native American tribes—along with the Maori, Warao, and Aboriginal people mentioned previously—these other belief systems are enough to fill a book of their own. Because this book focuses primarily on popular, contemporary religions, this introductory look at mythology limits itself to the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the tribes of Northern Europe. These are the ancient belief systems to which scholars pay the closest attention and which still influence Western culture today.FOUNDATIONS
ANCIENT EGYPT
Surrounded by deserts and dependent on the life-sustaining Nile River, the civilization of ancient Egypt began around 3000 BCE
 . It quickly developed a complex set of religious beliefs and practices. The Egyptians were polytheistic, attributing natural events such as the weather, the flooding of the Nile, and even sickness to the whims of a multitude of divine beings. They built temples to the gods and goddesses, offering sacrifices and performing magical rituals to gain their favor. They submitted to the rule of the pharaoh, who was believed to be the gods’ human representative on earth and the central figure in Egypt’s religious practice.
Their convictions, however, weren’t static—nor were the specific characteristics assigned to the gods and goddesses. Egypt’s mythology evolved as its civilization evolved, resulting in a complicated roster of more than a thousand deities. Some took the forms of animals or hybrid figures with human bodies and animal heads. Many attributes and responsibilities overlapped between them. Roles changed. Certain gods or goddesses began as local deities, worshipped only by a small tribe of people. As the centers of power shifted and political dynasties grew, the power and prestige of a local god might grow along with it.
Fundamental to Egyptian life and religion was the concept of maat
 , or order. Personified as the goddess Ma’at, maat also enveloped all aspects of human life, from the relationship between humanity and the gods to the role of the pharaoh. More than just a religious focus, maat also encompassed politics, ethics, and moral behaviors among citizens. It extended from the daily actions of people into the afterlife itself—which, on its own, was an elaborate dimension of Egyptian spirituality.
Within this isolated culture, these religious practices and principles thrived for centuries without external influence, dying out only when the civilization itself came to an end.
CREATION
There is no singular creation account in ancient Egyptian mythology. Prominent cities and regions in Egypt each had their own stories of how the world began. While these myths differed dramatically, a few elements overlapped. The best-known myth goes like this:
Before anything existed, there was nothing but Nu, or Nun, the primeval watery abyss. Out of these dark waters emerged a pyramid-shaped mound, known as Benben. The first god and source of everything, Atum, willed himself into being, arising from the mound. He rested there before sneezing Shu, the god of the air, into being. Then he spat, creating Tefnut, the goddess of moisture
Then Shu and Tefnut conceived two children of their own. One was Geb, the god of the earth. The other was Nut, goddess of the sky. Shu positioned Nut above Geb like a canopy, defining the regions of the natural world
Geb and Nut then consorted with each other and bore four children, each one representing one of the most important elements that make life possible: the handsome Osiris (fertility), the beautiful Isis (motherhood), the cunning Set (male sexuality), and the ferocious Nephthys (female sexuality). These nine deities were collectively known as the Ennead
Osiris then became king of the earth, ruling with his queen, Isis. Together they had a son, Horus. But Set grew angry and jealous of Osiris’s power. Eventually, he killed Osiris and sent him to the underworld, making himself ruler of the earth. But Horus fought Set and regained the throne, making Horus king of the earth and Osiris king of the underworld
This creation story comes from religious beliefs centering on Heliopolis, one of the oldest cities in ancient Egypt. While most other accounts include the waters of chaos and a hill rising from them—probably a reflection of the Egyptians’ constant concerns about flooding around the Nile River—they also differ in the details. Each location assumed it was the original location of Benben. The following are a few variations of the creation story based on the cities in which they originated:
■Hermopolis:
 Eight primeval, water-dwelling gods, collectively called the Ogdoad
 , created the mound. These gods existed in male-female pairs, with the males represented by frogs and the females represented by snakes. Due to their convergence, a mound arose from the waters, after which a bird laid a cosmic egg upon it. The sun god, Ra, hatched from the egg and lit the world.
■Memphis:
 The deity Ptah existed before all things. He was the god of craftsmen and conceived the world by thinking of it. First he created a daughter, who then gave birth to Atum. Everything else, from the gods and goddesses to the cities, flora, and fauna of the world, came into being as he spoke their names.
■Thebes:
 The supreme god Amun, though part of the Ogdoad, also transcended those deities. He willed himself and the rest of the Ogdoad into existence. He lifted the primeval mound out of the waters of chaos, then created the nine deities of the Ennead and established the world around them.
THE ANKH
An ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic shaped like a cross with a loop handle, the ankh
 symbolized the concept of eternal life. Almost every deity was shown carrying one, and it appeared frequently on temple walls, paintings in the tombs of pharaohs, and even pottery.
MAJOR DEITIES
Egyptian texts name more than a thousand divine beings with a seemingly endless variety of physical features, roles, and associations. The following eight represent the most prominent ancient Egyptian deities.
Amun
Role:
 Supreme god and creator of the universe
Relationships:
 Self-created
Appearance:
 Man wearing a pharaoh beard and a tall headdress of two vertical ostrich plumes, carrying a scepter and an ankh; occasionally shown with a ram’s head
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Thebes
An early patron deity of Thebes, Amun was first worshipped as the divine creator who willed himself and the universe into existence. He was also known as a champion of the poor and distressed. As Thebes grew in significance—eventually becoming the capital of Egypt—Amun’s religious role grew into one similar to that of Zeus in Greek mythology. Beliefs about Amun merged with beliefs about the sun god Ra, resulting in Amun-Ra, king of the gods and the most powerful deity of Egypt. Before long, all other Egyptian gods were viewed as manifestations of Amun-Ra, and the pharaohs attributed all their successes to him.
Anubis
Role:
 Protector of the dead; god of death, embalming, and funerals
Relationships:
 Son of Nephthys and Set (or Nephthys and Osiris, or Nephthys and Ra)
Appearance:
 Man with the black head of a jackal, carrying a scepter and an ankh
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Hardai (Greek name: Cynopolis)
First known as the protector of graves, Anubis eventually became the god who supported the tasks of embalming and mummification, as well as the one who guided deceased souls into the afterlife. He rose to become the god of the dead—a role that he lost when the cult of Osiris grew in popularity. Nevertheless, Anubis supervised the ceremony in which the heart of the departed was weighed against the feather of Ma’at to determine the fate of the soul. As a result, Anubis was represented frequently in Egyptian art and writing, but made few appearances in the actual myths.
Horus
Role:
 National god of Egypt, protector of the pharaoh, and god of the sky, war, and hunting
Relationships:
 Son of Osiris and Isis
Appearance:
 Man with the head of a falcon, wearing a red-and-white double crown and carrying an ankh
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Edfu
Stories about the origin of the god Horus changed dramatically over the centuries. In the earliest myths, he was considered the brother of Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys. Later, he was viewed as the son of Isis and Osiris. In this role, as Osiris’s heir who struggled against Set to avenge his father’s murder, Horus became one of the most significant gods in Egyptian mythology. In doing so, he assumed control over all the earth—which meant pharaohs were understood to be the human embodiment of Horus. As god of the sky, Horus became associated with the sun and the moon: One heavenly body was his right eye and the other his left. As he soared across the sky on falcon wings, the day became night.
THE EYE OF HORUS
The Eye of Horus
 is a pictogram that, along with the ankh, is widely viewed as a symbol of Egyptian religion. A symbol for royal power, protection, and good health, it was worn as an amulet or pendant by the living and was buried with the dead. Ships often bore the Eye of Horus to ensure a safe voyage.
Isis
Role:
 Goddess of marriage, wisdom, health, nature, fertility, and magic
Relationships:
 First daughter of Geb and Nut; sister of Osiris, Set, and Nephthys; wife of Osiris and mother of Horus
Appearance:
 Woman wearing a throne-shaped crown and carrying an ankh; occasionally shown with a cow’s head or horned headdress
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Philae, Abydos
The prestigious stature of Isis in ancient Egypt owes much to her role in the resurrection of Osiris. According to the best-known myth, Set murdered Osiris and tore his body into pieces, scattering them all over the world. 
 Isis used her knowledge of magic spells to gather the various parts and restore her husband to fullness, bandaging him together for burial. Impressed by his wife’s devotion, the gods granted new life to Osiris and instituted him as ruler of the underworld. Isis’s efforts are credited with the introduction of Egypt’s embalming practices and mummification rituals. Because the living pharaoh was seen as the human embodiment of Horus, Isis was sometimes viewed as the pharaoh’s mother.
Osiris
Role:
 Ruler of the underworld, god of death and resurrection, god of transition
Relationships:
 Firstborn child of Geb and Nut; brother of Isis, Set, and Nephthys; husband of Isis; father of Horus and Anubis
Appearance:
 Man with green skin (representing his association with vegetation, growth, and renewal) and a pharaoh beard, mummified below the waist and wearing a crown with two curling ostrich feathers; often shown holding a shepherd’s crook (symbolizing his kingship) and flail (symbolizing fertility)
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Abydos
As the king of the dead and merciful judge of the underworld, Osiris maintained a prominent place in Egyptian beliefs. His association with death and rebirth originated with the myth about his resurrection following his death at the hands of Set. Thereafter, Osiris granted life to Egypt through the annual flooding of the Nile—a powerful event that allowed crops to flourish once the waters receded. Early beliefs maintained that, after death, the pharaoh would be resurrected in the underworld, taking on the form of Osiris. Eventually, this belief shifted to stipulate that all the deceased would be welcomed into the kingdom of Osiris after completing the rituals of death and judgment.
Ra
Role:
 King of the gods, god of the sun, ruler of the created world
Relationships:
 Son of Nu, or self-created
Appearance:
 Man with the head of a falcon or hawk, carrying an ankh and crowned with a sun surrounded by a snake
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Heliopolis
As the sun god, Ra held a prominent place among Egyptian worshippers. Some believed his tears gave birth to humanity and credited him with the creation of the seasons. Egypt also associated him with resurrection, believing the sun died each night and journeyed through the underworld—or was swallowed by Nut, the sky goddess—only to rise again in the morning. Unlike other gods, Ra was not depicted in statue form in his places of worship. Instead, these structures opened to the sunlight. The pharaohs identified themselves as sons of Ra and built many of the pyramids in his honor. Eventually, the falcon-headed Ra and falcon-headed Horus merged into a single ruling deity.
Set/Seth
Role: God of storms, the desert, foreigners, darkness, violence, and chaos
Relationships:
 Son of Geb and Nut; brother of Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys; father of Anubis
Appearance:
 A snouted, dog-like creature often known as “the Set animal” with a forked tail and rectangular ears; alternately, a man with a dog-like head, carrying a scepter and an ankh
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Sepermeru
Though Set was usually considered a force that attacked harmony, the earliest Egyptians also revered him as a protector of Ra and the god of the desert. A temple in which he was worshipped was referred to as the “House of Set”; these temples were located in desert gateways like Sepermeru. Also the god of foreigners, Set became associated with foreign conflict, including Egypt’s occupation at the hands of the conquering Assyrians and Persians. The Egyptians, of course, were threatened by these invasions, and during these periods, they emphasized Set’s villainous role as the murderer of Osiris.
BENBEN STONE
 The top stone of an Egyptian pyramid is known as the Benben stone.
Thoth
Role:
 God of knowledge, wisdom, magic, writing, and science
Relationships:
 Husband of Ma’at, self-created
Appearance:
 Man with the head of an ibis or baboon, carrying a scepter and an ankh
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Hermopolis
The scribe of the underworld, Thoth maintained the library of the gods, created the spells in the Book of the Dead, and observed and recorded the weighing of souls in Duat
 , the realm of the dead. Thoth also mediated good and evil to ensure balance. As the god of wisdom and knowledge, he was credited with the invention of writing. He also directed the motions and distances of the heavenly bodies, and oversaw everything related to science, astronomy, and mathematics.
METHODS OF PRACTICE
While the most memorable details of Egyptian religious practice are related to what happened after death, the living maintained certain practices and beliefs as well. Worship in Egypt revolved around rituals and offerings made at the temple. Most cities and towns built vast temples devoted to specific gods. Each morning, a high-ranking priest—or sometimes even the pharaoh—would perform a series of elaborate ceremonial rites to appease a temple’s god. He would anoint and dress the divine statue of the god, then present offerings of food, flowers, and even mummified animals.
Other festivals throughout the year required priests to transport the statue to other temples in a ceremonial procession. This was the only time commoners had a chance to encounter the image of the god. During these processions, they would treat the statue as an oracle, making offerings or petitioning it with questions as it was carried by, then attempting to interpret an answer based on how it swayed or wobbled.
As for common religious practices apart from these rituals, Egyptians often kept small shrines at home dedicated to certain gods. Believing that demons brought danger and disease into their lives, they would appeal to the gods to intervene and protect them.
Magic played a substantial role in the beliefs of the Egyptians. The faithful would wear protective amulets during their daily routines and would attempt to use magic spells or incantations to conjure the gods’ favor.
DEATH AND THE AFTERLIFE
In Egyptian mythology, the subterranean realm of the dead was known as Duat
 . Osiris dwelled here, as did the sun god Ra, who traveled through Duat during the dark of the night, returning east before the next day’s sunrise.
Following death, a person’s soul would enter the dangerous landscape of Duat on its way to the Judgment Hall of Osiris. The  elaborate burial rituals performed for Egyptians served to prepare the dead for this transition. Believing the soul’s path to eternal life required a well-preserved physical body, embalmers would remove the corpse’s brain and internal organs, placing them in canopic jars to be buried with the body. The heart remained in the body, as it was thought to contain the essence of the soul and would be necessary in the journey to come.
Relatives of the deceased would place papyrus copies of the Book of the Dead in the burial chamber. These documents described the various magic spells necessary to navigate the underworld, where the traveler would have to pass through gates defended by terrifying guardians. Certain gatekeepers took the form of supernatural creatures with human bodies beneath the head of a snake, lion, or crocodile. Others included a hippo-headed lion and a knife-wielding dwarf with a scarab beetle perched upon his head.
The goal of this perilous journey was to reach Osiris, who would judge the deceased in a ritual called the Weighing of the Heart
 . Upon reaching the Judgment Hall, the departed soul would recite the Negative Confession
 —a comprehensive list of the sins he or she had not
 committed in order to adhere to Egypt’s moral code.
Once satisfied by this proclamation of worthiness, Osiris would place the heart of the deceased on a scale. Ma’at, the goddess of truth and justice, would place a feather on the other side. If the heart weighed the same as or less than the feather, that indicated the deceased had lived a life of virtue, and Anubis, who watched over the entire ceremony to ensure its accuracy, would guide the deceased to the blissful paradise Aaru
 , the Field of Reeds. However, if the sin-encumbered heart weighed more than the feather, the feared demon-goddess Ammit would devour it, dooming the soul to a restless eternity or even destruction. Part crocodile, part hippopotamus, and part lion, Ammit’s terrifying composite body represented the three deadliest animals known to the ancient Egyptians, and thus invoked deep fear
THE SACRED CAT
How important was the cat to ancient Egyptian society? In 1888, a farmer near Istabl Antar, Egypt, discovered a mass grave of mummified cats—not just a few bodies, but thousands of them, dozens of layers deep. Some were wrapped in linen. Others had gilded faces.
Ancient Egypt was likely one of the first civilizations to domesticate cats; they praised and honored them for their hunting ability— especially of deadly cobras and the vermin that could ruin Egypt’s valuable stores of grain. Respect for the cat’s vigilance against snakes and other pests gradually elevated it from being a popular pet to being a sacred animal. People mourned the death of a family cat just as they would mourn the death of a family member. Greek historians claimed that killing a cat in ancient Egypt—even accidentally—garnered the death penalty.
This symbiotic, protective relationship found its ultimate expression in the evolution of deities associated with cats. One was the early lion-headed goddess Mafdet, a “slayer of serpents” thought to protect Egyptians against snakes. In later centuries, Egyptians revered Bastet, a cat-headed warrior goddess who watched over the pharaohs of Lower Egypt.
THE SOUL
Ancient Egyptians believed the human soul was composed of the following five parts:
■Ib:
 The heart, which survived death and was the seat of emotion and thought
■Sheut:
 A person’s shadow, thought to serve Anubis and represent death
■Ren:
 A person’s name, which survived as long as the name was read and spoken
■Ba:
 A person’s unique personality or character, which was also thought to endure after the death of the body
■Ka:
 The spark or essence of life; death resulted when the ka departed the human body
THE END
As a civilization, ancient Egypt flourished for at least three thousand years. Its state-sponsored religion remained only as strong as the kingdom itself, eventually fading as the mighty culture that sustained it came to an end.
After the death of Pharaoh Ramesses XI in the eleventh century BCE
 , Egypt began to fracture into two kingdoms. In the southern city of Thebes, the powerful high priests of Amun used their vast wealth to restrict shipping on the Nile, controlling resources and thus governing the kingdom’s economy. Meanwhile, the pharaoh maintained a tenuous grip on Upper Egypt. The pharaoh ruled the north from Tanis, while the high priest of Amun ruled the south from Thebes. Though the empire would reunite several times in the centuries to follow, this schism weakened it—as did an Assyrian invasion in the seventh century BCE
 , followed by a Persian conquest in the next century. Then, in the fourth century BCE
 , Alexander the Great conquered Egypt. Following Alexander’s death some years later, Macedonian general Ptolemy I declared himself pharaoh. So although the state religion continued, Ptolemy and his successors immersed the people of Egypt in Greek culture and language.
In 30 BCE
 , Egypt was defeated by the Roman Empire, despite the efforts of Cleopatra VII and Mark Antony. Known for both 
 her intelligence and her romantic escapades, Cleopatra became the final pharaoh in a line of rulers established by Ptolemy. She and her lover Mark Antony, a Roman general, had joined forces in the wake of Julius Caesar’s assassination, using Egypt’s wealth to challenge Octavian, Caesar’s nephew and heir. After his triumph, Octavian became Emperor Augustus, made Egypt a Roman province, and ended the role of the pharaoh as an intermediary to the gods. In the next few decades, Christianity began to expand across the Roman Empire and into Egypt. It spread quickly there, possibly due to similarities between this new sect and Egyptian traditions: a belief in the judgment of souls and an afterlife, resemblances between the ankh and the cross, and likenesses between the resurrection stories of Osiris and Jesus Christ.
While Egyptians may have been relatively quick to embrace Christianity, the Christian religion was less tolerant of Egypt’s spiritual practices, rejecting and eventually forbidding their beliefs and practices as paganism. Hieroglyphics gave way to the Greek language. Temples were converted or destroyed. By the fourth century CE , pagan worship was outlawed, and Christianity had taken root across Egypt.
Despite the demise of this once-great culture, Egypt’s questions about the natural world and life after death inspired mythological answers that would soon be addressed by other great religions. Beyond being one of the world’s earliest civilizations, Egypt was also one of the first societies to posit the supernatural creation of the universe, the existence of a soul distinct from the physical body, and a realm of individual punishment in the afterlife. These ancient Egyptian concepts—along with the civilization’s mysterious pyramids, tombs, and related artifacts—continue to fascinate the contemporary world.FOUNDATIONS
ANCIENT GREECE/ROME
The myths and deities of ancient Greece and Rome are perhaps the most familiar of any early religious system. From the names of constellations to common English words like hypnosis
 and aphrodisiac
 , Greek mythology still permeates today’s Western culture.
The ancient Greeks were advanced for their time; they invented calculus and are credited with democracy and the Olympic Games. In some ways, however, they still had a primitive understanding of the world around them. For example, their myths sought to explain why lightning appeared in the sky (Zeus was hurling lightning bolts), why smoke was billowing from a nearby volcano (those were the forges of Hephaestus), or why the seasons existed (the vegetation goddess Persephone spent several months each year in Hades).
The earliest myths appear in the epic poetry of Homer, which dates back to the eighth century BCE
 and is generally considered the beginning of the Archaic Period of ancient Greece. The civilization itself lasted through the wars of Alexander the Great and into Greece’s annexation by Rome, at which point the opportunistic Romans began to assimilate many of the elements, gods, and stories of Greek religion into their own religious beliefs.
Just like their counterparts in Egypt, the Greek gods and goddesses weren’t static figures. Their attributes and associations changed as civilization changed. Oral histories and explanations were embellished along the way. Homer might tell one version of a certain myth, and later historians like Herodotus might add contradictory details. Nevertheless, the Pantheon of gods, regardless of their specific associations, existed as objects of worship until about the fourth century CE
GREEK VS. ROMAN MYTHOLOGY
If ancient Greece and ancient Rome were two separate cultures, why do their deities and beliefs overlap so much? The Romans were an open-minded people who admired Greek thought. Upon conquering this civilization, Rome began to assimilate Greek culture into their own—from their language to their philosophy to their myths. Romans simply adopted the religion of the Greeks, associating Greek gods with existing Roman gods.
In the Aeneid
 , written in the first century BCE, the Roman poet Virgil retold Homer’s Iliad
 from the perspective of a Trojan hero who became the ancestor of the founders of Rome. This connected Roman culture to the Greek civilization and “Romanized” the Olympic gods and goddesses.
CREATION
In the beginning, the great mother Gaia emerged from Chaos, the great void. As Gaia slept, she gave birth to the sky god, Uranus, who began to shower her with mists and rain. Their union created the mountains, clouds, rivers, lakes, trees, birds, and other creatures of the earth. Gaia gave birth to the sea god Pontus, and their union brought forth the deities and creatures of the sea. Uranus lay again with Gaia and fathered monsters, the one-eyed Cyclops, and the six sons and six daughters who became known as the Titans.
Worried that these children would someday unseat him from power, Uranus captured each Titan as he or she emerged from Gaia’s womb. He imprisoned them deep within Gaia’s body, where they began to cause the earth mother significant pain. So she equipped her cleverest, most hateful child, Cronus, with a deadly sickle, instructing him to take away his father’s fertility once and for all.
The next time Uranus lay with her, Cronus leaped from Gaia’s loins and castrated his father with the blade. In the aftermath, drops of Uranus’s blood fell onto Gaia’s body. From these drops emerged other beings, including the Furies (spirits of vengeance and justice). Uranus, the sky, then separated from Gaia, the earth. Cronus released his brothers and sisters from captivity and became the king of the gods.
The Titans ruled the universe until Cronus had the same concerns about being overthrown by the children he fathered with Rhea, his sister and wife. As Rhea gave birth to Hestia, Hades, Demeter, Poseidon, and Hera, their father Cronus devoured each one whole. But rather than handing baby Zeus over, Rhea bundled up a rock in swaddling clothes and gave it to Cronus instead. She then raised Zeus in secret.
Eventually Zeus grew up, forced his father to disgorge all his siblings, and enlisted those siblings in a war against Cronus and the elder Titans. Zeus and the Pantheon of gods and goddesses overthrew the Titans and ruled Greece from Mount Olympus.
MAJOR DEITIES
Though Greek mythology includes a number of minor gods, goddesses, and demigods, its most significant deities were the Twelve Olympians, so named because they were thought to dwell at the top of Mount Olympus.
MOUNT OLYMPUS
The ruling gods and goddesses of ancient Greece dwelled atop Mount Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. Although they lived in separate palaces, they came together in a great hall called the Pantheon in Zeus’s palace. Each sat in a throne designed to fit his or her personality. Poseidon’s throne, for example, was decorated with coral and shells, because he presided over the sea. In this hall, the gods held lengthy conversations and ruled the world.
Zeus
Role: King of the gods, ruler of Olympus, god of thunder and lightning
Relationships:
 Husband of Hera; brother of Hestia, Hades, Demeter, Poseidon, and Hera; father of Ares, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, and Hermes
Appearance:
 Muscular, bearded man holding a lightning bolt
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Olympia
Roman Equivalent:
 Jupiter
Zeus overthrew his father Cronus, and led the Olympians in defeating the Titans. His leadership during this war gained him the title “king of the gods” and established him as ruler of Olympus. He used his power to consort with a bewildering number of goddesses, women, and nymphs (nature spirits resembling nubile maidens)—often overcoming them through trickery or rape. Through these sexual exploits, Zeus fathered divine heroes such as Heracles and Perseus, the mortal Helen of Troy, and many immortals, including the Muses and the Graces.
Hera
Role:
 Queen of the gods
Relationships:
 Wife of Zeus; sister of Hestia, Hades, Demeter, Poseidon, and Zeus; mother of Ares and Hephaestus
Appearance:
 Beautiful woman wearing a crown, often holding a pomegranate or peacock feather
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Samos, Argos
Roman Equivalent:
 Juno
Known as the queen of heaven by virtue of her marriage to Zeus, Hera also presided over weddings, women, and family. Just as Zeus was notorious for his womanizing, Hera had a reputation for bitter jealousy. Most of the stories about her in Greek mythology revolve around the revenge she directed toward Zeus’s lovers. Nevertheless, the ancient 
 Greeks valued both marriage and childbirth, and worshipped Hera due to her connection to those pillars of family life.
Apollo
Role:
 God of art, music, poetry, light, knowledge, and oracles
Relationships:
 Son of Zeus, twin brother of Artemis
Appearance:
 Young, beardless man, often wearing a laurel wreath
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Delphi, Thebes
Roman Equivalent:
 Apollo
Apollo was one of the most complex and significant deities of Olympus. Over the centuries, he attained a lengthy list of responsibilities—most likely assimilating the characteristics of a number of different local deities. He was an archer thought to protect cattle and sheep. As the god of music and a skillful player of the lyre, he was a close companion to, and even choral director of, the nine Muses. He was also responsible for delivering health and sickness. Because it was believed that Apollo always told the truth, this god inspired the Oracle of Delphi, the most important shrine in all of Greece, where people sought to have their questions about the future answered.
Ares
Role:
 God of war
Relationships:
 Son of Zeus and Hera
Appearance:
 Muscular, beardless man, usually wearing a helmet and holding a spear or shield
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Sparta, Athens
Roman Equivalent:
 Mars
The most bloodthirsty god in the Greek Pantheon, Ares was known for two things: being the ruthless embodiment of warfare, and having a sexual relationship with Aphrodite, the goddess of love. The Greeks were generally peaceful, putting less value on war than other cultures at the time, so Ares played only a minor role in this culture. In their myths, he was often humiliated or aligned with the losing side of a battle.
Artemis
Role:
 Goddess of the hunt, the moon, archery, childbirth, virginity, forests, and hills
Relationships:
 Daughter of Zeus and Hera, twin sister of Apollo
Appearance:
 Beautiful but stern woman, often carrying a bow and arrows and wearing a knee-high dress with bare legs
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Delos, Ephesus
Roman Equivalent:
 Diana
Artemis was by far the most widely worshipped goddess in ancient Greece, praised for her self-sufficiency, freedom, and connection to the natural world. Both beautiful and dedicated to her virginity, she led a passionate group of followers through the hills and forests of Greece. Though she often went to vengeful lengths to protect her own virginity or that of her retinue, she became known as the goddess of childbirth and fertility. Pregnant women prayed to her for a safe and easy birth.
Athena
Role:
 Goddess of wisdom, combat, victory, and the sciences
Relationships:
 Daughter of Zeus
Appearance:
 Tall, slender woman, often wearing a helmet and bearing weapons
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Athens
Roman Equivalent:
 Minerva
As the patron of combat, Athena fought with cunning rather than weaponry and bloodshed, an approach that represented the Greek personality and set her apart from Ares, the god of war. Athena was a virgin goddess who presided over inventing, weaving, and crafts, and was considered the protector of cities. Athens was named for her, and the spectacular Parthenon was built in her honor. In one of Greek mythology’s most unusual birth stories, Athena emerged fully grown from the head of Zeus.
Demeter
Role:
 Goddess of the harvest, fertility, agriculture, and the seasons
Relationships:
 Sister of Hades, Poseidon, Hestia, Zeus, and Hera
Appearance: Woman in modest dress and head veil, holding a staff or sacrificial flame
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Eleusis
Roman Equivalent:
 Ceres
One of the most popular Greek gods, Demeter ensured an abundant harvest, presided over moral justice and the divine order of law, and represented the cycle of life and death. She was beloved for her role in the story of Hades and Persephone: After Hades kidnapped her daughter Persephone, Demeter neglected the world’s crops to pursue her. The barren winter months symbolized her absence from the world and the springtime her return. The ancient Greeks sacrificed to her the first loaf of bread from every harvest.
Dionysus
Role:
 God of nature, wine, festivals, vegetation, religious ecstasy, and theater
Relationships:
 Son of Zeus
Appearance:
 Sometimes aged, bearded, and robed; sometimes young, beardless, and naked, with wild hair
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Athens
Roman Equivalent:
 Bacchus
Though his reputation was inconsistent from one century to another, Dionysus managed to gain a significant reputation among the people of Greece. Appropriately, he represented chaos and revelry, and was associated with people on the margins of society. Everywhere he went, he left dancing, drinking, and music in his wake. A popular wine-celebrating festival called Dionysia
 was held annually in his honor.
Hades
Role:
 God of the dead, ruler of the underworld
Relationships:
 Brother of Hestia, Poseidon, Demeter, Zeus, and Hera
Appearance:
 Gloomy, bearded man, often appearing with the three-headed dog Cerberus
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Thesprotia
Roman Equivalent:
 Pluto
Hades was associated with death and feared more than any other god. In fact, his very name came to represent the Greek concept of the afterlife. However, because precious stones also came from belowground (the location of the underworld over which Hades ruled), the Greeks considered him the god of wealth as well. To appease him, they sacrificed black sheep and goats to the sea, as black was associated with the underworld. They kept their faces covered out of respect for, and terror of, the god. Hades is well known for kidnapping Persephone and dragging her into the underworld to become his queen.
Hephaestus
Role:
 God of fire, forges, volcanoes, blacksmiths, metalworking, and sculpture
Relationships:
 Son of Zeus and Hera
Appearance:
 Unattractive, bearded man, usually leaning on a cane and wearing a craftsman’s tunic
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Lemnos, Athens
Roman Equivalent:
 Vulcan
Hephaestus was known as the most unattractive god in a family of gorgeous divine beings. Born with deformities, he became further crippled when his mother, Hera, threw him from Mount Olympus. As the stories go, Hera regretted her behavior and built her son a workshop. In this workshop, Hephaestus created beautiful things, including the girdle of Aphrodite, the armor of the hero Achilles, and the winged sandals worn by Hermes. This god’s penchant for craftsmanship won him the favor of Aphrodite, who married him.
THE ROD OF ASCLEPIUS AND THE CADUCEUS
The rod of Asclepius
 is a staff, entwined by a single snake, representing the Greek god of medicine and healing. The Greeks considered the shedding of a snake’s skin to be a symbol of physical restoration, and nonvenomous snakes were connected to Asclepius and often kept at healing centers devoted to him.
A similar yet unrelated image is the caduceus
 , a winged staff entangled by two snakes, an ancient symbol of commerce associated with Hermes. Due to historical confusion or misinterpretation in the nineteenth century, the caduceus—rather than the more appropriate rod of Asclepius— became linked with modern medicine.
Hermes
Role:
 Messenger of the gods; god of travelers, athletes, merchants, and transitions
Relationships:
 Son of Zeus
Appearance:
 Young, beardless man wearing a winged, flat-brimmed hat and winged sandals
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Arcadia
Roman Equivalent:
 Mercury
Hermes was the emissary between gods and mortals, able to move quickly between the two realms. His interaction with humans made him a popular figure in myths. He was thought to help guide souls into Hades, as he was the only god other than Hades and Persephone who could enter and depart the underworld. He presided over games of chance and was considered the god of thieves.
Hestia
Role:
 Goddess of the home and hearth, architecture, and domesticity
Relationships:
 Sister of Hades, Poseidon, Demeter, Zeus, and Hera
Appearance:
 Woman in modest dress, with golden hair and a veil, holding wheat or a cornucopia
Temple/Center of Worship:
 None in particular; every city had a “flame of Hestia” that burned continuously
Roman Equivalent:
 Vesta
Hestia, firstborn of Cronus and Rhea, maintained the sacrificial fires of Olympus. Her fire-keeping duties left little time to interfere with humanity, so she appeared in few myths. The ancient Greeks considered Hestia passive and humble, but also associated her with happiness and hospitality. Because the hearth was the center of Greek family life, she was worshipped in homes rather than in elaborate temples. The first offering from every meal was given to her.
Poseidon
Role:
 God of the sea, earthquakes, storms, and horses
Relationships: Brother of Hestia, Hades, Demeter, Zeus, and Hera
Appearance:
 Muscular, bearded man carrying a trident
Temple/Center of Worship:
 Athens, Corinth
Roman Equivalent:
 Neptune
Along with Zeus and Hades, Poseidon was one of the three most powerful gods in ancient Greece. He ruled the sea, which acted as a barometer of Poseidon’s mood. Calm seas meant he was pleased. Storms, floods, high winds, earthquakes, and other weather events indicated his displeasure. Sailors would sacrifice horses to the sea to appease the god and ensure safe passage across the Mediterranean. Like Zeus, Poseidon consorted with a variety of lovers and fathered hundreds of children and monsters.
METHODS OF PRACTICE
Though the ancient Greeks had no specific word for religion
 or any authoritative religious texts, acknowledging and appeasing the gods were foundational to both public and private life. They believed that everything—from the weather to the smallest details of their lives—fell under the gods’ control, and they wanted to make sure their personal piety met the gods’ approval.
Official religious ceremonies took place at temples dedicated to specific gods. The earliest temples were caves or mountaintops thought to be the dwelling places of certain deities. Eventually, simple wooden structures arose at these locations, replaced later by more elaborate marble constructions.
The largest cities had temples honoring specific gods—such as the Parthenon at Athens, built to honor Athena—which usually included a statue of the deity in question. These temples were sometimes surrounded by smaller temples or altars to lesser gods. Faithful Greeks would give money to these temples, offer prayers as they passed by, and leave small sacrifices of food or flowers as a way of expressing gratitude. Larger, citywide sacrifices of animals would take place at an outdoor altar in front of the temple. The animals’ sex would match the gender of the deity, and certain gods and goddesses were thought to prefer certain sacrifices—for instance, bulls were always offered to Zeus and cows to Hera. Priests or priestesses would assist with the sacrifices.
Festivals also played a large role in worship. The largest festivals—such as the one honoring Zeus every four years at Olympia, a precursor to today’s Olympic Games—were attended by people from across the countryside and included athletic competitions, processions, and sacrifices. Other festivals included theater and musical competitions in addition to athletic games. Smaller local festivals were open to select individuals or initiates.
Different locations in the home would be dedicated to certain gods, reminding Greek citizens to offer a prayer during their daily routines. Smaller sacrifices of domestic animals were common on altars in front of the home. The family would burn the fat and bones of the animal for the gods, then eat the best parts themselves.
CORNUCOPIA
A symbol of prosperity, the cornucopia
 is a “horn of plenty” overflowing with fruits, vegetables, and other elements of the harvest. Before becoming a popular Western symbol of the harvest (and the American holiday of Thanksgiving), the cornucopia originated in ancient Greece. It derives from a number of myths, most notably one in which a mother goat named Amalthea nourished the infant Zeus with her milk. The powerful god didn’t know his own strength and accidentally broke off one of her horns. From that point on, he blessed her broken horn to provide eternal abundance. In later Greek literature, the horn of Amalthea became the cornucopia, associated with Demeter and the harvest.
DEATH AND THE AFTERLIFE
The ancient Greeks believed the soul separated from the body at the moment of death and was transported to Hades, a shadowy subterranean kingdom of the dead that served as the dark counterpart to Mount Olympus and was ruled by the god Hades and his queen, Persephone.
After a journey guided by Hermes, the soul entered the underworld, which was guarded by the three-headed dog Cerberus. Here, the newly dead encountered the terrifying ferryman Charon, whose task was to transport each soul across the Styx
 , a river encircling Hades. (Some ancient sources identify this river as the Acheron.) This ride cost a coin, so relatives would bury their dead only after placing a 
 coin under the tongue of the deceased. Souls without the coin were doomed to wander the earth as restless spirits.
Upon entering Hades, the judges of the underworld—Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus—decided which section of the afterlife would receive each soul.
Ordinary souls—souls that lacked the heroism or ethical merit to gain admission to paradise, but hadn’t committed crimes significant enough to warrant punishment—were destined for the Fields of Asphodel
 . Life in the Fields of Asphodel was largely viewed as meaningless—souls were stripped of any distinguishable personalities or social positions.
The virtuous or heroic were transported to Elysium , also known as the Elysian Fields
 , which lay in sunshine beyond the darkness of Hades. The souls of Ajax, Achilles, and Odysseus’s son Telemachus were believed to reside here for eternity. According to some traditions, upon arriving in Elysium, a soul could choose to remain there forever or be reborn. Should a soul be reincarnated and earn entrance to the Elysian Fields three separate times, its reward was eternal life on paradisiacal islands known as the Fortunate Isles
 or the Isles of the Blessed
Souls who wronged the gods, on the other hand, received individualized punishment befitting their crimes in the Fields of Punishment
 or in Tartarus
 , a deep abyss of suffering where Zeus had cast the Titans after defeating them. It was believed that Tartarus existed as far below the underworld as the earth was below the sky.
THE SOUL
Along with the ancient Egyptians, the Greeks were among the first to distinguish the physical body from the soul. Greek philosophers like Socrates and Plato argued that the psyche
 , or soul, was a person’s nonphysical essence. External behavior was a reflection of the soul’s characteristics. At the time of death, the soul departed from the body and journeyed to the afterlife, which meant the presence of a soul was what distinguished a living human from a corpse. Plato’s teaching on the immortality of the soul may have influenced early Christianity, which differed from Judaism in this belief.
THE END
Though the gods were believed to be immortal, the ancient Greek religion was not. By the end of the second century BCE
 , Rome was expanding throughout the Mediterranean and conquering the older civilizations it encountered; these conquered civilizations included Greece, and the polytheistic religious beliefs of the Greeks began to merge with those of Rome.
By the time Jesus began a new movement within Judaism, Greek philosophy had begun to spread into Palestine and the lands surrounding it. Rome’s polytheistic religion may have been able to fold in the repurposed Greek deities, but Christianity forbade that. 
 Arising from monotheistic Judaism, it viewed devotion to the Greek and Roman gods as pagan practices from which followers of Christ must abstain.
As Christianity grew in influence— spreading into Greece and other parts of the Roman Empire—beliefs in the ancient gods of Greece and Rome began to decline. Centuries later, Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, giving the Christian church a much greater foothold. With this power, the Empire began to close temples and establish laws to prevent worshipping the false gods of the Pantheon. In 380 CE
 , Emperor Theodosius I issued the Edict of Thessalonica, instituting Christianity as the Roman Empire’s official state religion. Though a few pockets of polytheistic belief survived in the following centuries, this edict essentially ended the practice of the Greek religion. Zeus/Jupiter had lost his throne to Christ.
Nevertheless, elements of Greek mythology—phrases like Achilles’ heel
 or words like aphrodisiac
 —continue to appear in modern language. In the night sky, many of the constellations and planets in our solar system (Orion, the Pleiades, Mars, Jupiter) owe their identities to these myths. Cities from Aurora, Colorado, to Zephyr, Ontario, are named for ancient Greek deities. And certain aspects of the myths were paralleled in later religions like Christianity, from the existence of a hellish underworld to the popular folk depiction of God as a bearded, Zeus-like heavenly figure.FOUNDATIONS
ANCIENT NORDIC REGION
Egyptian civilization arose in isolation. The Pantheon of Greek gods remained confined to Greece until those beliefs were assimilated into the Roman Empire. But Norse mythology and ritual were widespread. Indigenous to the Germanic peoples of Northern Europe—including the seafaring Vikings—these ancestral beliefs extended from Norway and Sweden to Denmark, Normandy, and even Iceland and Greenland. They expanded with each Viking raid and evolved into a complex set of beliefs, stories, and rituals
The Viking Age is thought to have begun with the raid of the island of Lindisfarne off the coast of England in 793 CE
 and ended in 1066 CE
 , with the Battle of Hastings. While the Vikings offer the most prominent example of the pre-Christian people of Northern Europe, not all Norsemen were pillaging warriors. Most were average people—farmers, shopkeepers, and the like.
Until the arrival of Christianity, residents of Northern Europe were polytheists. They believed in a diverse cast of gods, goddesses, giants, elves, dwarves, and heroes spread across the Nine Worlds of Yggdrasil (see sidebar here
 ). The stories about these gods explained how the land and sea and sky came to be. Sacrifices earned good fortune and the favor of these gods, who lived in and were even identified by the wild places of the natural world. This element also made Norse religion pantheistic. Unlike ancient Greek beliefs, in which Zeus ruled from his palace on Olympus, divinity wasn’t something separate from the visible world. The material and the spiritual were one and the same. Thor was thunder. Thunder was Thor.
These beliefs or practices weren’t necessarily considered a religion. They were simply a way of life—the stories and traditions of every family, settlement, and the larger community around them.
CREATION
A gap of nothingness existed between Muspelheim
 , the region of fire and light, and Niflheim , the land of mist and ice. This abyss was called Ginnungagap
 , a silent, chaotic void. Flames and smoke erupted from Muspelheim, while rivers of ice flowed from Niflheim, and these two opposite elements met in Ginnungagap. Warmed by the fire, the ice melted into droplets, which formed Ymir—the first giant, or Jotunn
 . Ymir’s drops of sweat created more giants.
Soon, another being emerged from the melting frost: Audhumbla the cow. Ymir drank her milk, and Audhumbla began to lick the ice. This uncovered Búri, the first Aesir deity. Búri’s son, Bor, married the daughter of a giant and gave birth to the half-god, half-giant Odin and his brothers.
Odin ruled the Aesir. With the aid of his brothers, Odin killed Ymir and used the giant’s corpse to construct the world of humans. From Ymir’s flesh, they created soil. His blood became the oceans and lakes. His hair became vegetation, and his teeth became rocks. Dwarves stationed at the north, south, east, and west held aloft his skull, which formed the sky. Odin appointed two beautiful giants, a brother and sister, to be the sun and moon.
Odin and his brothers produced the first human beings—a man and a woman named Ask and Embla—from the wood of two tree trunks washed up on the shore. They then created Midgard
 , a place of civilization where Ask and Embla could dwell protected from the giants.
THE NINE WORLDS OF YGGDRASIL
The Norse conception of the universe contained nine worlds, all connected to Yggdrasil
 , an expansive ash tree. These worlds included Midgard
 , where humans lived, and Asgard
 and Vanaheim , where the two tribes of gods and goddess, the Aesir
 and Vanir
 , lived, respectively. Elves and dwarves had realms of their own (Alfheim
 and Svartalfheim
 ), as did giants (Jotunheim
 ). The remaining worlds were Niflheim
 (world of ice), Muspelheim
 (world of fire), and Helheim
 (world of the dead). The giant dragon-serpent Nidhogg
 constantly chewed at the roots of the great world tree with the desire to reintroduce chaos to the worlds.
MAJOR DEITIES
Norse deities are divided among separate clans called the Aesir
 and Vanir
 . The Poetic Edda
 and Prose Edda
 mention dozens of these gods and goddesses by name. These are a few of the most noteworthy.
Odin
Role:
 Chief of the Aesir and ruler of Asgard
Relationships:
 Husband of Frigg, father of Thor
Appearance:
 One-eyed, long-bearded man, wearing a broad hat and a dark cloak
Tribe:
 Aesir
Modern Impact:
 The English word Wednesday (“Odin’s day”)
The most powerful deity of Asgard, Odin represented war, battle, death, and victory, along with happiness, music, and magic. Odin sacrificed one of his eyes in exchange for wisdom from the divine being Mimir. Despite this disability, he could see into the past and future, and was therefore considered the god of prophecy. Odin was said to ride an eight-legged horse, Sleipnir, across the sky, and presided over Valhalla
 , the great hall of the afterlife.
Thor
Role:
 God of thunder, lightning, strength, oak trees, healing, and fertility
Relationships:
 Son of Odin
Appearance:
 Huge, with a red beard, carrying a hammer known as Mjolnir
Tribe:
 Aesir
Modern Impact:
 The English word Thursday (“Thor’s day”)
A war god, Thor was viewed as the protector of humanity against the giants. He gained great strength by wearing a powerful belt and lived in the biggest of Asgard’s houses. He drove a chariot across the sky, drawn by two goats. The chariot’s turning wheels made the sound of thunder, while lightning sparked from his hammer, Mjolnir, when he used it to fell giants. His hammer could also knock down mountains and revive dead people and animals—including his own goats, which he often ate and resurrected. The Norse appealed to this god for protection and sanctification.
Loki
Role:
 Trickster, bringer of discord
Relationships:
 Father of Hel and mother of Sleipnir
Appearance:
 Shape-shifter
Tribe:
 Aesir
Loki was a shape-shifting, irreverent chaos deity who seemed to exist only to make trouble for the rest of the gods. He could appear as a human of either sex or as any animal. Once, in the guise of a mare, he mated with the stallion Svadilfari and gave birth to Sleipnir, Odin’s eight-legged horse. Loki’s only allegiance was to himself, which meant his amoral actions sometimes benefited the gods and sometimes helped the giants.
Baldur
Role:
 God of light and the midsummer sun
Relationships:
 Son of Odin and Frigg
Appearance:
 Handsome and radiant
Tribe:
 Aesir
A beloved favorite of the gods and goddesses, Baldur is primarily known for his death. After he and his mother, Frigg, both dreamed of Baldur’s demise, Frigg required everything in her realm to promise to never hurt her son. Then, thinking Baldur was invincible and looking to amuse themselves, the gods began hurling weapons at him, the weapons bouncing off harmlessly. However, Loki—the bringer of discord—fashioned a spear from deadly mistletoe and gave it to the blind god, Hodr. When Hodr threw the poisonous spear at Baldur, it killed him. Baldur was condemned to the grave until Ragnarok
 , the end of the age, at which time he would be resurrected.
RAGNAROK
The Prose Edda
 and the Poetic Edda
 (the most extensive sources of Norse mythology) both refer to Ragnarok
 —a final, merciless battle between the gods and the Jotunn in which deities like Odin, Thor, and Loki would perish and the world would be destroyed. However, because Norse mythology viewed time as cyclical, Ragnarok represented death and
 rebirth, rather than the end of days. In fact, when Ragnarok arrived, it was foretold, two humans would survive and repopulate the renewed world.
Freya
Role:
 Goddess of love, beauty, sexuality, and fertility
Relationships:
 Wife of Odr, daughter of Njord, and twin sister of Freyr
Appearance:
 Woman wearing a necklace known as Brisingamen
Tribe:
 Vanir
Modern Impact:
 The English word Friday (“Frija’s day”)
Freya was the highest of the Vanir goddesses. Her characteristics overlap with Frigg’s, and they seem to be distinct only in name. Freya’s husband, Odr—an obscure Old Norse deity— is most likely an extension of Odin.
Freyr
Role:
 God of virility, prosperity, the rain, the sun, and the fruit of the earth
Relationships:
 Son of Njord and twin brother of Freya
Appearance:
 Male, often with an erect phallus
Tribe:
 Vanir
One of the most significant Norse gods, Freyr was responsible for the wealth, peace, health, and fertility of the human race. He had sexual relationships with a variety of goddesses, including his sister. On land, he traveled in a chariot drawn by a boar with a glowing mane. On sea, he sailed in a dwarf-made ship, which came with its own favorable winds and could be folded up into a pouch. People made sacrifices to Freyr to celebrate a harvest or wedding.
Frigg
Role:
 Goddess of love, marriage, motherhood, weaving, and fertility
Relationships:
 Wife of Odin, mother of Baldur
Appearance:
 Female, with long blond hair and a gold headband
Tribe:
 Aesir
Modern Impact:
 The English word Friday (“Frija’s day”)
The highest Aesir goddess, Frigg shared many characteristics with the Vanir deity Freya. Most likely the two goddesses were evolutions of Frija, an ancient Proto-Germanic deity. Frigg was thought to have the gift of prophecy, sitting at a spindle and weaving the destinies of both the humans and the gods—though she refused to reveal this knowledge. Frigg was regularly unfaithful to her husband, Odin.
Njord
Role:
 God of the sea, sailing, wind, fishing, and wealth
Relationships:
 Father of Freyr and Freya
Appearance:
 Male, often with an erect phallus
Tribe:
 Vanir
Widely worshipped, Njord was a prominent member of the Vanir, although he is featured at length in only one story, about his marriage to the giantess Skadi, who mistook him for the much-loved Baldur. Skadi wanted to 
 live in the mountains, but Njord preferred to live near the sea, so their marriage was an unhappy one. Sailors and fishermen often invoked Njord for successful voyages.
THE DISCOVERY OF RUNES
Before the Germanic peoples adopted the Latin alphabet, their written language consisted of runes—mystical carved symbols that represented far more than just letters of an alphabet. The runes were considered a type of magic, which Odin attained by hanging himself upside down from a branch of Yggdrasil and piercing himself with the tip of his spear. He spent nine days and nights on the verge of death before the sacred runes accepted his sacrifice and revealed to him their secrets.
METHODS OF PRACTICE
The physical world was thought to be a manifestation of the gods and goddesses, so the construction of human-made temples was not emphasized. Within this polytheistic, decentralized religion, the rituals of worship took place at home (generally overseen by the head of the family), at arrangements of sacrificial stones known as horgr
 , or within sacred streams or groves. Rather than being a special class of priests, religious leaders, known as godar
 , were generally public leaders with wealth or political power.
Sacrifices were part of daily life, with sacramental feasts and offerings to the gods for wealth, safety, and an abundant harvest. These offerings were often left beneath “guardian” trees or near sacred wells.
An eleventh-century work does tell of a national religious center at Uppsala, in modern-day Sweden, where Odin, Thor, and Freyr were worshipped. The three gods were depicted in statue form sitting on thrones. A priest was said to be assigned to each god, and sacrifices were made to them—occasionally even human sacrifices—according to their associations. The corpses of humans, dogs, and horses were said to hang from sacred groves planted beside the temple.
While the archaeological evidence of a temple at Uppsala is not disputed, the descriptions of its rituals were written by an author associated with the Church of Bremen and may have been influenced by unreliable Christian accounts. Nevertheless, violence was very much a part of everyday life during the Viking Age and ritual human sacrifice may have been an occasional part of religious practice.
THE AESIR, VANIR, AND JOTUNN
Alongside minor beings like dwarves and elves, three major tribes or races existed in Norse cosmology. The Aesir
 and Vanir
 were each clans of gods. The best-known deities—for instance, Odin and Thor—belonged to the Aesir and largely acted as warrior gods. The Vanir included Njord, Freya, and Freyr, and had closer ties to wealth and fertility. These two tribes were said to be at peace with each other following a lengthy war, but they continued to oppose the third: theJotunn
 , a race of giants who were the ancestors of the Aesir. Often translated as “giants,” their name comes from a Proto-Germanic word that means “devourer.” While the Aesir fought to hold the Jotunn in check, the Jotunn sought to return the universe to chaos.
DEATH AND THE AFTERLIFE
One of the nine worlds, Helheim
 was the ancient abode of mist, an underworld beneath Yggdrasil. This world was presided over by Hel—a gloomy, half-blue, half-white giantess who likely lent her name to the English word hell
 . However, this realm was not a place of torment like the Christian hell, nor did it have a moral dimension. It was simply a land for those who had died of sickness or old age, where life continued as usual, with eating, sleeping, and other daily activities—just in a different place.
Norse literature also mentions another realm of the dead called Valhalla
 , or the “hall of the slain.” Located in Asgard and ruled by Odin, Valhalla welcomed warriors slain in battle, who were escorted into a glorious afterlife by fierce battle-maidens called Valkyries
 . In Valhalla, beneath a roof of overlapping shields, warriors would spend their remaining days in combat, preparing for Ragnarok (see sidebar here
 ).
A distinction between Valhalla and the all-purpose underworld of Hel only appears in the Prose Edda
 , and some scholars believe it may have been an invention of the work’s thirteenth-century, post-Christianization author. It is likely that the Norse believed they would all end up in the same place after death, regardless of their actions or battlefield valor.
People believed their ancestors were still able to influence life in Midgard and took great efforts to treat them correctly at death to ensure their blessing. The dead were buried with special rituals and alongside holy objects. Sacrifices of food and drink were common at graves in this form of ancestor worship.
RELIGIOUS TEXTS
Like all ancient religions, Norse mythology was primarily communicated orally. It was not a scriptural religion, and little was written down. Most of what is currently known about Norse mythology comes from two texts—the Poetic Edda
 and the Prose Edda
 —both of which were influenced by Christianity.
The Poetic Edda
 is an anonymous collection of poems from the Codex Regius
 , a thirteenth-century manuscript from Iceland. The poems were likely composed over several centuries during the gradual Christianization of Iceland.
The Prose Edda
 is an account of Norse origins written by the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson in the thirteenth century, and frequently references the Poetic Edda
 . Though Iceland was one of the last regions to be dominated by Christianity due to its remoteness, the Prose Edda
 was written after
 Norse paganism’s decline.
THE END
Just like the religions of ancient Egypt and ancient Greece, Norse beliefs thrived until overcome by the spread of Christianity. The Christian faith arrived in Northern Europe in two distinct ways. The first was self-imposed. 
 Viking raiders into England, Ireland, and France often returned with captives. Men would become slaves. Women would become wives. Many of them were Christians who held onto their faith despite their suffering, raising children who believed in Jesus alongside Thor.
Other influences arrived via Anglo-Saxon and German missionaries, who in the eighth and ninth centuries began their attempts to convert the local polytheistic “heathens.” Recognizing that the Norse people regarded certain hilltops or groves as sacred, the Christians built small chapels near those places, siphoning off the location’s spiritual significance. Because the Vikings already believed in many gods, it wasn’t too much of a stretch to add the Christian god to their list of deities. It helped that the symbolic hammer of Thor—often found carved into gravestones or stamped as a talisman on weaponry—could easily be transformed into the sign of the cross.
As Christianity spread, tensions developed between those following the old pagan ways and those following the new Christian ways. Some chieftains or tribal kings would convert for political reasons, and the settlements surrounding them would follow their lead. At least a few pagan leaders—like one chieftain in the Faroe Islands—converted rather than face death.
By the eleventh century, most of Norway, Iceland, and Denmark had been Christianized. Sweden held on for another century until Christianity was cemented there midway through the twelfth century. Throughout Northern Europe, pagan sites were destroyed, ritual sacrifices were moved to the margins, and belief in the gods of Norse religion faded away. Nevertheless, their influence continues in the contemporary world—and not just because Thor is a popular hero in the Marvel comics and movie universe.
The legends about these gods and goddesses have influenced epic fiction from J. R. R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings
 to J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. The influence of Germanic languages on Old English resulted in Norse gods appearing in the names of days of the week, like, for example, Wednesday (“day of Woden,” or Odin). Even the Western celebration of Christmas—a holy day observing the birth of Jesus—draws from Nordic mythology, from the centrality of the Christmas tree (a nod to Thor’s sacred oak) to the timing of the holiday itself (which is in line with the Germanic midwinter Yule festival). The Norse gods may have diminished, but they are hardly forgotten.PART TWO
THE TWELVE
Most students of world religions have heard the old story about the blind men and the elephant. It’s a popular story because it illustrates how humans—even those living in similar cultures and time periods—have come to such different religious conclusions about reality. The familiar tale goes like this:
A group of blind men encounter an elephant and begin touching it in order to comprehend the creature’s size and shape. One says the elephant must look like a sturdy pillar. Another says the elephant is long and narrow like a rope. Another says the elephant is like an immovable, textured wall … or a thin, flexible fan … or a smooth, hardened pipe. Each man believes he is right. Before long, they begin to argue about the true nature of the elephant
Of course, despite their disagreement, all the men are correct about the elephant. It’s just that each has only understood one part 
 of the whole. One man is touching the elephant’s leg, another the elephant’s tail. The others are assessing the beast’s side, ear, and tusk.
When viewed as an allegory or parable, this story introduces a number of common questions related to world religions: Is religious truth relative? Does each religion represent a partial understanding of a transcendent whole? When it comes to our universe or the purpose of life, are humans grasping blindly at something incomprehensible?
These are worthwhile questions. But perhaps even more interesting is the origin of the story itself. A brief survey of the Internet or the religious section of a bookstore will find this story attributed to multiple sources. Is it an ancient Hindu legend, a parable revealed by the Buddha, or a story recalled in ninth-century Jain texts? Even the thirteenth-century Islamic mystic Rumi told this story in the Masnavi
 , one of his most famous poems.
If the elephant story illustrates the subjectivity of experience and the value of diverse perspectives, its history also reveals the connections between world religions. Buddhism split from Hinduism; Jainism arose in India around the same time. Islam came along several centuries later, spreading from the Middle East into Rumi’s Afghanistan and further into India and Southeast Asia. Rumi’s subversive teachings drew from several traditions. All these religions may have appropriated this story for themselves.
Even though Jesus never told a parable about elephants—they weren’t roaming the hills of first-century Palestine—it’s easy to imagine it illustrating a truth within the Judeo-Christian tradition, which has an equally tangled history: Christianity began as a Jewish sect, and the Jewish faith may have drawn elements from Zoroastrianism. Meanwhile, Sikhism has roots in Hinduism, Shia Islam gave birth to the Bahá’í Faith, and the Shinto traditions of Japan as well as China’s Taoism and Confucianism are inextricably enmeshed with the Buddhism that dominates Asia. Sometimes it’s hard to determine where the elephant’s torso ends and its legs begin.
The following chapters take a close, comparative look at these world religions—the twelve most popular in human history and practice. For most of the twelve, “popularity” refers to the number of people who practice the religion worldwide. Others, like Zoroastrianism, Taoism, and Confucianism, may have a relatively small number of adherents but remain enormously influential in the rituals and beliefs of much larger systems. An elephant’s trunk and tail are both parts of the same creature, but they are completely different in form and function. That seems to be the case with the following twelve religions.
CHRISTIANITY
Though the worldwide scope of religious belief and practice is changing, Christianity is likely what most Westerners think of when they hear the word religion
 . The faith dominates the English-speaking world, the Spanish-speaking world, the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, and large parts of Asia. With more than two billion practitioners, it is the most widely practiced religion on the planet—and the most diverse. From the elaborately attired priests of Eastern Europe and the suburban Evangelicals of Texas to the Pope in Rome and the child in a village in Kenya, all Christians adhere to a religious system that evolved from Judaism and centers on the final few years in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, a carpenter’s son from a small village in first-century Palestine.
From these humble beginnings arose a movement that would dominate the next 2,000 years of Western civilization—a civilization that, in many ways, is hardly distinguishable from Christianity. The spread of this faith bears responsibility for the demise of the mythological beliefs of Egypt, Greece, and Northern Europe.
To this faith, the world owes the modern institutional versions of orphanages, hospitals, and higher education, along with the intellectual revolutions of the Enlightenment. Renaissance painting and architecture, classical music, and the abolition movement, as well as the modern movements for workers’ rights, women’s suffrage, and civil rights, were all by-products, directly or indirectly, of Christian beliefs and actions. Despite Christianity’s positive influences in many areas, Christians were also responsible for the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, the Thirty Years’ War, the genocide of native civilizations in the Americas, the Salem witch trials, American slavery and the slave trade, the Third Reich in Germany, “the Troubles” in Northern Ireland, the Rwandan genocide, and other atrocities. Clearly, Christianity has been both a positive and negative force in the world.
A COMING KINGDOM
With its roots in Judaism, Christianity emerged as a movement within first-century Palestine—a fairly remote outpost in the eastern Mediterranean occupied by the Roman Empire. However, the existence of this movement had more to do with the state of Jewish religious culture than with Rome. At the time, the Jews believed in a coming Messiah, a powerful political leader prophesied to unify Israel, rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, and restore worship there, liberating the Jews from the occupying Roman forces. Meanwhile, Jewish religious leaders maintained a near-tyrannical grip on the common people. These judges and temple priests lived in luxury, supported by an oppressive temple tax, and had instituted a daily sacrifice to Caesar at the temple in Jerusalem. Many of these leaders may have even supported the Roman occupation.

 The Bible (Old and New Testaments)
Part social movement and part political party, another ruling religious class, the Pharisees
 , piled a spiritual burden on the people. They paid strict attention not just to the Law of Moses
 (the Torah, or the first five books in the Old Testament), but also to the Jewish oral traditions surrounding it. Their lives were governed by a religious zeal reflected in rules about work, fasting, ritual purity, and other personal pieties.
This was the culture into which Jesus stepped when he began his public ministry around 30 CE
 . An itinerant Jewish prophet, teacher, and proclaimed miracle-worker, he appealed primarily to the poor. He gathered disciples and followers, and traveled the countryside, preaching an ethical code based on love for one’s neighbor rather than the ironclad rule-keeping of the Pharisees, whom he often challenged. Jesus spoke of a coming kingdom and impending judgment, teachings that set him against the wealthy Jewish 
 leaders and the representatives of Rome, who began to worry about a Jewish uprising.
Eventually, the Jewish authorities collaborated with Roman rulers to execute Jesus by crucifixion as a criminal and revolutionary. Three days later—according to his most devoted followers—he was resurrected. This convinced a small group of Jews that Jesus was indeed the Messiah. But they believed that rather than lead a violent overthrow of Rome, Jesus would someday return to bring about the coming kingdom of God.
Historically, the bulk of what is known about Jesus comes from the biblical eyewitness accounts in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Written decades after his death by his followers in hopes of spreading his teachings, these sympathetic accounts are regarded as true and accurate by the faithful but viewed suspiciously by nonbelievers or impartial historians. However, a few extrabiblical mentions of Jesus do exist, in works by authors from the Jewish historian Josephus to Roman writers like Suetonius and Tacitus. These are enough for most scholars to have concluded that Jesus of Nazareth was indeed a historical figure who was crucified by the Romans and who lived in a time of powerful messianic expectation. Whether he rose from the dead or was the incarnate son of God are theological questions that remain unconfirmed by history.
BREAKING FROM JUDAISM
Jesus was a Jew and his earliest followers were Jews. Christianity began as a sect within Judaism, and both religions trace their origins to Abraham. Both believe in the same all-powerful creator: God. Both share the same spiritual heritage and scriptures (the Old Testament, or Hebrew scriptures). Both teach a similar ethical code. Both practice worship on a particular day of the week (the Sabbath for Jews, Sunday for Christians).
But within the first few generations, Christianity and Judaism separated completely based on the identity of Jesus. Christians recognized him as the fulfillment of Jewish prophecies about the Messiah, believing Jesus to be the resurrected savior and incarnation of God. Jews recognized Jesus as a powerful prophet and teacher but denied his resurrection and messianic identity.
Today, while Christians respect and value their shared spiritual heritage with Judaism, they see the Jewish religion as incomplete
MAJOR FIGURES
The list of major figures in Christianity is a lengthy one, beginning with Jesus Christ and continuing through centuries of influential saints, theologians, scholars, reformers, and modern leaders.
Jesus Christ
Jesus was a young man from Nazareth, who is believed to be a descendant of King David and to have been born miraculously to Mary, a virgin. Around age thirty, Jesus began a public ministry in which he performed miracles, healed the sick, and challenged Jewish conventions by associating with women, lepers, and others on the margins of society. He told parables to his followers, including a close group of disciples, which illustrated and proclaimed the coming “kingdom of God.”
Eventually, his public appeal caught the attention of Roman and Jewish authorities in Jerusalem, leading to his arrest, trial, and execution by crucifixion. According to his followers, Jesus rose from the dead three days later. His sacrificial death reconciled with God the sins of humanity and established him as the son of God and the long-awaited Christ (a Greek translation of the Hebrew Messiah
 , which means “anointed one”).
THE CROSS
The cross
 , representing the death of Jesus Christ by crucifixion, is an ancient symbol that predates Christianity and may have origins related to the Egyptian ankh. While its use as a devotional symbol was rare in the first centuries—crucifixion, after all, was associated with a gruesome death—the cross eventually replaced other icons as the primary emblem of the Christian faith.
The Virgin Mary
Mary, the mother of Jesus, is believed to have conceived him by the Holy Spirit while still a virgin. According to the Gospel narratives, Mary delivered Jesus in Bethlehem after the angel Gabriel told her she had been chosen to bear the son of God. Mary was also present at the beginning of Jesus’s public ministry and his eventual crucifixion. Early apocryphal writings (writings outside the biblical canon) indicate that Mary did not die a typical death but was taken bodily into heaven. Beliefs about Mary vary widely today. Catholics believe in Mary’s bodily assumption and perpetual virginity, and assert that she herself was immaculately conceived and free from original sin—making her the most important saint within Christendom. Protestants dispute these characteristics and tend to focus only on Mary’s limited role in the birth narrative, the crucifixion, and a few other brief appearances in the New Testament.
Paul of Tarsus (Saint Paul)
Paul of Tarsus, or Saint Paul, was the first Christian missionary and, apart from Jesus, the most significant figure in the early Church. Originally a persecutor of Christians called Saul, Paul changed his name and converted after Jesus appeared to him in a vision. He then became a passionate missionary who preached the Christian message to gentiles (non-Jews) throughout the Mediterranean region. Paul helped form several Christian communities, and his letters to those churches and associated individuals make up much of the New Testament. Among other teachings, Paul is responsible for correlating the death and resurrection of Christ with the forgiveness of sins. He was eventually imprisoned in Rome and is believed to have died a martyr.
Augustine of Hippo (Saint Augustine)
An early, highly influential Christian theologian and bishop from the fourth century, Augustine of Hippo defined the theology and beliefs of early Christianity more than any other thinker, excluding Paul of Tarsus. His hundreds of sermons, letters, and other written works applied Platonic philosophy and thought to the traditions of early Christianity and interpretation of its scriptures. Augustine’s Confessions
 —the story of his upbringing and religious conversion—is widely viewed as the first autobiography in Western literature. His influence and teachings fostered, among many others, the Christian doctrine of original sin and the need for salvation.
Constantine
Constantine was a Roman emperor whose conversion to Christianity in 312 CE
 gave enormous political power to the burgeoning sect and helped it replace paganism throughout the Empire. By signing the Edict of Milan, Constantine guaranteed religious tolerance for Christians, ending decades of persecution. Afterward, he helped organize the Council of Nicaea, during which the Christian doctrine of the Trinity was settled. Within the next century, Christianity came to dominate the Roman Empire. While some historians believe Constantine didn’t experience a true conversion and simply used Christianity to his political advantage, his efforts were nonetheless a significant turning point in the history of the faith.
MARTYRS
 Religious believers who faced persecution or even death because of their faith are called martyrs
 . The early history of Christianity is rich with stories of martyrdom at the hands of the Roman Empire or other non-Christian cultures, beginning with the death of Jesus. Many martyrs are recognized as saints within the Catholic Church.
Francis of Assisi (Saint Francis)
Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of Italy, was a Roman Catholic friar and preacher, and one of the world’s most revered religious figures. 
 Francis bridged the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and was the son of a successful merchant. After receiving a vision of Jesus in a small chapel, he renounced his wealthy upbringing and embraced a life of poverty. He is known for the many religious orders he founded (including the eponymous Franciscan order), his compassion for animals and the poor, his love for the created world, and the assembly of the first known nativity scene in a public celebration of Christmas.
Thomas Aquinas
Thomas Aquinas was a thirteenth-century Italian Catholic priest and is considered one of the most influential theologians and philosophers in the Catholic Church. Known for his attempts to reconcile faith and reason, Aquinas’s unfinished Summa Theologica
 presented strong philosophical arguments for the existence of God, along with an emphasis on individual ethics. It remains one of the most significant pieces of writing in Western literature. His methods, principles, and philosophies form the foundational teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.
John Wycliffe
John Wycliffe, a fourteenth-century English theologian and early reformer, opposed the authority of the Pope and believed it was more important for individuals to understand the Bible than to participate in the sacraments of the Church. For this reason, he oversaw what came to be known as Wycliffe’s Bible—the first widespread English translation of the Old and New Testaments. Though Wycliffe died of natural causes in 1384, he was posthumously declared a heretic by the Roman Catholic Church. Authorities exhumed his body from consecrated ground, set fire to his corpse (along with his writings), and cast the ashes into a river.
Martin Luther
In the early sixteenth century, Martin Luther, a German monk, came to believe that faith alone—rather than strict adherence to religious dogma—brought salvation. Luther grew disillusioned with his Roman Catholic tradition, especially the Church’s selling of indulgences , or paid remission of required punishment for sins. This culminated in a public act of defiance in 1517, when Luther composed a list of ninety-five theses critical of the Church. According to legend, he nailed the document to a chapel door in Wittenberg, then reprinted and disseminated the document throughout Europe, starting a theological rebellion. Martin Luther was excommunicated from the Catholic Church, and his teachings and influence set the Protestant Reformation in motion.
John Calvin
John Calvin was a leading figure of the Reformation and the father of Calvinism, a branch of Protestantism now associated with particular views of God’s foreknowledge and control over individual salvation. John Calvin was raised Roman Catholic in France, but left the church in 1530 and began advocating on behalf of the Reformation. He wrote the highly influential Institutes of the Christian Religion
 , established a strict religious government in Geneva, and trained pastors who spread his teachings throughout Europe. Calvin’s missionary efforts directly led to the formation of the Scottish Presbyterian Church, the Puritan movement in England, and the Dutch Reformed Church.
Mother Teresa
Born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu to an Albanian family, Mother Teresa was the founder of the twentieth-century Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic order of nuns who today oversee hundreds of hospices, medical clinics, treatment centers, and other homes for the poor. She spent most of her life as a nun in Calcutta, India, ministering to the poorest of the poor. She gained international recognition for her charitable works and received the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. Mother Teresa died in 1997. The Roman Catholic Church is in the process of canonizing her as a saint.
Billy Graham
The most prominent American Christian evangelist of the twentieth century, Billy Graham became popular due to his international crusades and relationships with American presidents. By the time he retired in 2005—in addition to his dozens of books and radio and television broadcasts—Graham was estimated to have preached his message to live audiences totaling 215 million people in 185 countries. He was ordained in 1939 in the Southern Baptist Church, but his ministry truly began to flourish in response to fears related to communism and the Cold War. A journalist once labeled Graham “the Pope of Protestant America.”
TO BE CHRISTIAN
 “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” —Jesus Christ
MAJOR TENETS
What are the primary beliefs of Christianity? Despite enormous deviations in the worldwide practice of the faith, most Christians hold to the following fundamentals.
Creation
God created the universe ex nihilo
 (out of nothing), shaping the earth, sun, stars, plants, animals, and humans over six days before resting on the seventh day. Christians debate whether these were literal twenty-four-hour days or symbolic “days” covering millions of years. The first humans, Adam and Eve, dwelled in the Garden of Eden before being cast out (see sidebar here
 ).
Deity
God is the supreme, all-good, all-powerful creator of the world who desires a personal relationship with humanity. There is only one God, expressed in three distinct persons: the Father, the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. This doctrine is called the Trinity
Scriptures
The life of Jesus Christ is the primary revelation of God, as described in the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. These scriptures and the traditions of the church are the sources of Christian theology and ethical practices.
Ethics
Basic Christian ethics consists of following the teachings and sacrificial example of Jesus, as well as the moral instruction given throughout the Bible. Jesus taught that the height of obedience was to love God with all one’s heart, mind, soul, and strength, and to “love your neighbor as yourself.”
The Ten Commandments are also central to Jewish and Christian ethics. The Old Testament tells of God giving Moses and the people of Israel a set of laws written on stone tablets. These rules are listed in two separate places in the Old Testament—the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy—and include seven prohibitions (murder, adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, stealing, lying, and coveting), plus three instructions (worship only God, honor one’s parents, and keep the seventh day of the week holy).
Salvation
All humans have an automatic inclination to sin by breaking God’s law. This doctrine is known as original sin , and is believed to have been passed down through every generation of humans due to the initial rebellion of Adam and Eve (see sidebar here
 ).
Because of this rebellion, humans have impaired their relationship with God. The sacrificial death of Jesus Christ reconciled humanity with God and made salvation possible. Doctrines about the process of salvation vary among Christian traditions, but most agree it begins with belief that Jesus is the son of God and that he was resurrected from the dead.
Death and the Afterlife
Those who are saved are promised eternal life in the presence of God in heaven, a place where there will be no tears or pain. Those who are not saved may face eternal punishment and separation from God in hell—though this belief is not universal in Christian traditions.
The End of Time
Jesus will return at the end of time in an event known as the Second Coming
 or the Rapture
 . He will descend from heaven at the sound of a great trumpet, judge the world, resurrect the departed faithful, defeat Satan and the forces of evil, and usher in a new kingdom on a remade earth. Some Christians hold that any believers who are alive at the return of Christ will be “raptured,” or taken up into heaven to meet Jesus. A number of controversial Christian movements have attempted to predict the return of Jesus and the end of the world based on select interpretations of biblical passages.
THE CREATION STORY
The Old Testament book of Genesis gives two distinct accounts of creation. The first chapter focuses primarily on cosmology and tells the following story:
God created the universe out of nothing. The earth was a formless, dark, watery void until God spoke light into existence. He then spoke into existence the heavens, the dry land, the stars and moon and sun, the creatures of the seas, the birds of the air, and the beasts of the earth. Then, in his own image, God created humanity and proclaimed his creation “very good.” These acts of creation took place over six days. On the seventh day, God rested from his work
The second and third chapters of Genesis describe the Garden of Eden, home of the first humans:
God formed the first man, Adam, from the dust of the ground, breathing life into him and commanding him to tend the garden. He forbade Adam from eating the fruit of a specific tree in the center of the garden—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Because the man was alone, God set out to create a helper for him, forming animals and birds and allowing Adam to name them. None of these creatures provided a suitable helper, so God caused the man to sleep and removed a rib from the man’s side. From that rib, God created the first woman, Eve. Both were naked. A talking serpent tempted Eve to eat of the forbidden tree. When she did, she gave the fruit to her husband. Upon eating it, both realized they were naked and sewed clothing for themselves. For their disobedience, God cursed the man with a life of toil and the woman with the pain of childbirth, and then cast them out of the garden
BEAUTIFUL OR BRUTAL
Even apart from its religious significance, the Bible remains one of the most influential books in the history of world literature— especially the 1611 King James translation into English.
Whether they’re adherents of Christianity or not, many in the Western world recognize the familiar phrasing of Psalm 23 (“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want”) or the Lord’s Prayer (“… thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”). Other passages are equally poetic, whether illustrating the relationship between Jesus and the Father (“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”) or describing the end of days (“… they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come”). The Bible has given Western civilization some of its most beautiful and soaring language.
At the same time, the Bible also contains some of the most disturbing passages ever written. The psalmist praised the warrior who “taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.” Prophets like Jeremiah predicted what would happen when God abandoned people to evil: “I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege.” New Testament writers like Peter spoke approvingly of slavery, while Paul advocated submission of wives to their husbands— ideas unthinkable to many people today.
Worship/Practice
Until Christ’s return, Christians are to worship and seek a relationship with God, spread the message of Jesus, and practice love and service to their fellow humans. Communities of Christians are called churches
 , and gather regularly (usually on Sundays, which reflects the day of the resurrection) to support each other in these practices.

In the native tongues of certain cultures, the earliest Christian missionaries were known as “people of the book.” While the emphasis on scripture varies from one strand of Christianity to another, the Bible remains the basis of the religion, serving as a guide for faith, behavior, church practice, and the will of God. The following writings have been important to Christianity over the ages.
The Old Testament
The original Hebrew Bible and the sacred scriptures of the Jewish faith, the Old Testament includes the five books of the Pentateuch or Torah (Genesis through Deuteronomy), the Prophets (historical books like Joshua and Judges, along with Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jonah, and others), and the Writings (which include Psalms and Proverbs). The thirty-nine books of the Old Testament were likely composed between 1200 and 165 BCE
The New Testament
The New Testament is an anthology of writings about the teachings and life of Jesus and other events in the earliest days of the Christian Church. It includes the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), which tell the story of Jesus, the Letters (written by or attributed to church leaders like Paul and Peter), and the book of Revelation. The twenty-seven books of the New Testament were written between 50 and 100 CE
The Confessions of Saint Augustine
The first spiritual autobiography, The Confessions of Saint Augustine
 was written by one of the great Church fathers, Augustine of Hippo.
The Rule of Saint Benedict
A fifth-century guide for the life and spirituality of monks, The Rule of Saint Benedict
 was written by the founder of Western monasticism.
Divine Comedy
 by Dante Alighieri
Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy
 is a three-part epic poem about the Christian afterlife. The contemporary Christian view of hell and the afterlife may owe more to Dante’s fourteenth-century descriptions than to biblical teaching on the subject.
The Imitation of Christ
 by Thomas à Kempis
Written in the fifteenth century, The Imitation of Christ
 promotes humility and a life of Christian simplicity. Apart from the Bible, it may be the most widely read and translated devotional book in the world.
CHRISTIAN FICTION
 The Left Behind series, by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, is a series of best-selling novels based on the book of Revelation. This series has influenced popular beliefs about the Second Coming of Christ and the end of the world.
Institutes of the Christian Religion
 by John Calvin
A Protestant manifesto published in 1536, Institutes of the Christian Religion attacks the “unorthodox” practices of the Catholic Church while detailing Protestant doctrines and practices.
Dark Night of the Soul
 by Saint John of the Cross
A sixteenth-century work about the difficulties endured in the pursuit of God. Still today, Christians use the phrase “dark night of the soul” to describe a spiritual crisis.
Pilgrim’s Progress
 by John Bunyan
The Pilgrim’s Progress from This World to That Which Is to Come; Delivered under the Similitude of a Dream
 —or Pilgrim’s Progress
 for short—is a Christian allegory about the path to salvation, written in 1678.
Orthodoxy
 by G. K. Chesterton
Orthodoxy
 is an influential autobiography about the author’s transition from agnosticism to Christianity.
The Cost of Discipleship
 by Dietrich Bonhoeffer
An exploration of what it means to commit to Christianity, The Cost of Discipleship
 was written by a German pastor and anti-Nazi dissident. Bonhoeffer’s phrase “cheap grace” has become a common expression among Evangelicals.
Mere Christianity
 by C. S. Lewis
Mere Christianity is a modern classic containing arguments in favor of Christianity and explanations of the faith.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
Christian worship takes a variety of forms, with different practices emphasized differently from one tradition to another. Christianity arose from Judaism, in which participants gathered for Sabbath rituals and regular festivals. For Christians, worship is both a communal activity and an individual practice. The Bible teaches that God requires worship and remains present during worship. A few of the most prominent practices include the following:
Leaders
Clergy are the men and women who have been formally (or informally) trained to preside over religious activities and teach the doctrines of the church. These may be income-earning, full-time careers supported by a church, or purely volunteer positions. Within various traditions, clergy are known by a variety of names, including priests, pastors, preachers, deacons, bishops, clerics, and ministers.
Houses of Worship
The earliest Christians gathered to sing hymns, pray, and worship in homes and on hillsides. Today, many Christians continue to meet informally, but most gather in dedicated places. These may be large, ornate cathedrals or sleek, contemporary auditoriums. The design of these houses of worship  varies depending on both the geographical location and the branch or denomination—from the array of candles and icons in an Eastern Orthodox church in Russia to the bare simplicity of a Southern Baptist church in the United States.
Religious Gatherings or Services
Most Christians gather on a weekly basis— usually on Sundays—for communal singing, prayer, scripture reading, a homily or sermon explaining a biblical passage, and a sacred ritual known as the Eucharist
 or Communion
 . These gatherings may follow a formal or informal structure, depending on the tradition.
Eucharist
Also known as Holy Communion
 or the Lord’s Supper, this ritual involves the sharing of bread and wine according to the example of Jesus Christ and his disciples before his execution. Some traditions use actual baked bread and wine. Others substitute unleavened bread and grape juice. In formal church traditions, like Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, the Eucharist is considered a sacrament: a special ceremony that conveys an internal, divine grace (see sidebar here
 ).
Baptism
Based on the example of Jesus, who was baptized by John the Baptist, Christians are welcomed into the life of the church through this water-based ritual, which is performed by a member of the clergy. The significance of the act, the age of the individual, and the method of handling the water (full immersion, pouring upon the head, sprinkling) vary widely. Baptism is also considered a sacrament and a means of salvation by many church traditions (see sidebar here
 ).
FULL-TIME DEVOTION
Monastics
 are men (monks
 ) or women (nuns
 ) who often separate themselves from the world to practice spiritual work as a vocation. This full-time devotion often has a specific focus, such as prayer, solitude, caring for the poor, or, in ancient times, manuscript copying. Most modern expressions of monasticism align with the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions, though new forms have begun developing within Protestantism.
Missionaries
 are followers of Christ who dedicate their lives—or a season of their lives—to entering an unfamiliar region or culture to spread the Christian message or serve those who live there. Paul of Tarsus, in the New Testament, was considered the first Christian missionary. Notably, the contemporary Southern Baptist Church emphasizes ministering to “unreached” people groups via mission work, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encourages all young men between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five to serve in two-year missionary programs.
THE SACRAMENTS
Within the various branches of Christianity, particular rituals are elevated above others as sacraments
 . These are the most prominent ones, considered outward signs of Christ’s power and presence.
CATHOLICISM AND EASTERN ORTHODOXY
Baptism: A ritual incorporating individuals, usually children, into the life of the church. The individual is washed or sprinkled with water while the Trinity is invoked. Baptism is viewed as essential for salvation.
The Eucharist:
 The consuming of consecrated bread and wine to remember Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. In these traditions, the elements are believed not only to symbolize the body and blood of Jesus, but also to become
 his body and blood in a mystical or even physical sense (this varies widely by denomination). For this reason, the Eucharist is the most important sacrament of the faith, observed every week.
Confirmation: An anointing with oil after an individual’s baptism, in which a bishop or priest lays hands on an individual and “seals” the adherent with the Holy Spirit. This is considered both a profession of faith and a rite that strengthens faith.
Penance:
 The repentance of sins, which usually takes place after a private confession of sinful acts in the presence of a priest. Following these confessions, a priest may impose an act of penance or say a prayer of forgiveness.
Anointing of the Sick:
 Also known as “extreme unction,” this practice involves an ordained priest applying holy oil to a sick or injured person. The ritual is believed to promote physical healing as well as spiritual healing or forgiveness.
Matrimony:
 The Christian marriage covenant.
Holy Orders:
 The ordination of ministerial offices, including those of deacons, priests, and bishops. These are usually administered by a bishop and involve recitations, prayers, and the “laying on of hands,” a practice that confers authority.
ANGLICANS*
 AND PROTESTANTS
Baptism:
 Beliefs about baptism differ among Protestants. Anglicans, Episcopalians, and Lutherans view baptism as a requirement for salvation and baptize infants. Methodists view baptism as an initiation into the life of the church but not an act of salvation. Other Christian denominations, including Southern Baptists, view baptism as a symbolic profession of faith and a show of obedience that occurs after salvation.
Eucharist:
 Also known as the Lord’s Supper or Holy Communion, this ritual involves the sharing of bread and wine (or grape juice) during worship. Protestants have a range of viewpoints about the relationship of these elements to Jesus Christ. Some, like Lutherans, believe Jesus is present in the elements via mystical union. Others, like Baptists, believe the bread and wine are merely symbolic. Many denominations observe Communion on a weekly basis. Others observe it less often.
*
 As a “middle ground” between Protestants and Catholics, Anglicans view baptism and the Eucharist as the two sacraments ordained by Jesus in the New Testament and therefore the most important. The other five are recognized as valuable but the exact nature of their effects and importance are frequently disputed.
Marriage Rituals
Christians believe marriage is a divine institution created by God in the Garden of Eden, then further sanctified by Jesus’s miracle at Cana, during which he miraculously changed water into wine at a wedding. A Christian wedding takes place in a church setting, with a priest or pastor guiding the bride and groom in the exchange of vows.
Prohibitions and Sin
Though Christians believe the sacrificial death of Jesus provides ultimate forgiveness of sins, the Bible also instructs them to confess their sins to God through prayer and ask his forgiveness.
The Roman Catholic Church classifies sins into two categories. Venial sins
 are less serious and may only damage one’s relationship with God. Mortal sins
 committed deliberately—for instance, blasphemy or abortion—entirely separate a person from God. If not confessed, these will result in an eternity apart from God in hell. Protestant churches tend not to classify sins in this way.
Repentance
Following the confession of sins to God or a member of the clergy, Christians are expected to repent, or turn away from that behavior. If another person has been sinned against, the individual must ask that person’s forgiveness. Within the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox traditions, repentance may be accompanied by acts of prayer or self-denial to make spiritual amends.
Music/Chants
Communal Christian worship typically includes communal singing of psalms, traditional hymns, or contemporary music. Based on the denomination or tradition, this may be a simple process led by a single priest or minister, or a more elaborate event led by a choir or band.
TO BE CHRISTIAN
 “I am not a Christian because God changed my life; I am a Christian because of my convictions about who Jesus Christ is.” —American author Josh McDowell
Prayer/Meditation
Prayer includes expressions of praise or gratitude to God, requests for personal help, or appeals on behalf of others. Beliefs and practices about prayer differ throughout the Christian tradition. Prayers are offered 
 in silent meditation or spoken aloud, said in group settings or privately. They can involve formal recitations or extemporaneous language, physical gestures (kneeling or making the sign of the cross) or no gestures at all.
A COMMON PRAYER: THE LORD’S PRAYER
The Lord’s Prayer
 , also called the Our Father
 , is one of the most common prayers still said by Christians. It originated with a prayer Jesus taught his disciples, as recorded in Matthew 6:5–13 and Luke 11:2–4. One of the most common recitations comes from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer
 (1662):
Our Father, which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name;
thy kingdom come;
thy will be done,
in earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive them that trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation;
but deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever
Amen
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
While the Christian holy days of Easter and Christmas are observed throughout Western culture, others are primarily observed within a religious setting.
ASH WEDNESDAY (FEBRUARY OR MARCH)
Ash Wednesday
 marks the first day of Lent and a day of fasting. During Ash Wednesday services, ashes are applied to the foreheads of participants, often in the shape of a cross. These ashes are usually made from palm branches used on Palm Sunday during the previous year.
LENT
Lent
 is a solemn forty-day period of fasting and/or self-denial that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends at Easter. Christians often abstain from certain behaviors, including the eating of meat, while adding devotional practices like charitable giving or Bible reading. The period is modeled on the New Testament story of Jesus’s forty-day fast in the desert, at the end of which he was tempted by Satan.
PALM SUNDAY (MARCH OR APRIL)
The Sunday before Easter, known as Palm Sunday
 , is for remembering the Gospel story of Jesus’s arrival in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. During this event, crowds laid palm branches in front of Jesus as he rode a donkey into the city, an event known as the triumphal entry
 . Church services on this day often include a procession of worshippers carrying palm fronds. Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week
MAUNDY THURSDAY (MARCH OR APRIL)
The Thursday before Easter, Maundy Thursday
 is a holy day marking the Last Supper, during which Jesus shared bread and wine with the disciples as the first Eucharist or Communion. “Maundy” may come from the Latin word mandatum
 , used in the Latin translation of a commandment Jesus made during the Last Supper. Some Christians ceremonially wash one another’s feet on this day, commemorating Christ’s act of service toward his disciples.
GOOD FRIDAY (MARCH OR APRIL)
Good Friday
 is the holy day remembering the crucifixion of Jesus. It falls on the Friday before Easter and is a fast day for many Christians. Special worship services are solemn and focus on the sin of humanity as well as the sacrifice and death of Jesus. This day is also known as Holy Friday
 or Great Friday
 and is often a public holiday in Western countries.
EASTER (MARCH OR APRIL)
Easter
 is a joyful celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, three days after his crucifixion. Easter takes place on the first Sunday after the full moon that follows the spring equinox. This holy day is the culmination of the forty-day period of Lent and is often commemorated with special sunrise services, parades, and joyful worship. Easter is the culmination of Holy Week.
PENTECOST (MAY OR JUNE)
Pentecost
 is the Sunday occurring seven weeks after Easter, marking the arrival of the Holy Spirit upon early followers of Jesus, according to the New Testament book of Acts. In many liturgical churches, this is a day celebrated with baptisms and confirmations. The Monday after Pentecost is a public holiday in many Western countries.
ALL SAINTS’ DAY (NOVEMBER 1)
A holy day mostly observed by Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians, All Saints’ Day
 commemorates the religion’s martyrs and other faithful who have died, including deceased family members. Also known as All Hallows’ Day
 , it played a role in the development of customs related to the largely secular activities of Halloween (a contraction of “All Hallows’ Eve”), on October 31.
ADVENT (LATE NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER)
The Christmas season, commemorated on the four Sundays prior to Christmas Day, is known as Advent
 . Christian churches usually decorate for Christmas and use these Sundays to await the coming, or “advent,” of Jesus into the world. In addition to remembering the birth of Christ, the expectant mood of the season symbolizes the longing for Christ’s return.
CHRISTMAS (DECEMBER 25)
The day celebrating Christ’s birth, Christmas
 is a public holiday in Western countries. Unless Christmas falls on a Sunday, Christian churches usually observe the holiday with candlelight services on Christmas Eve. Participants sing carols, read the nativity stories from the New Testament, and light candles to symbolize the arrival of light in a time of darkness. Christmas is also a secular holiday, observed through the giving of gifts and other traditions.
DIVISIONS
From the beginning, Christians have interpreted the Bible and practiced their faith in a variety of ways. Even in the first century, the faith’s most prominent leaders, including the Apostles Paul and Peter, disagreed about how to best follow Jesus’s teachings. Over subsequent centuries, large groups fought over Christian practice, theology, and even which writings to allow into the biblical canon. Large schisms further splintered the faith. Eastern Orthodoxy split from Roman Catholicism in 1054, and the Protestant movement abandoned the Catholic Church in the sixteenth century.
Today, Christianity is primarily split into those three branches: Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestants. These groups are further divided, with self-identifying Christians in one camp refusing to accept the faith of other self-identifying Christians. Many evangelical Protestants do not believe that Catholics are “saved.” Many Catholics do not believe Protestants are members of the true church. Mormons and Jehovah’s Witnesses claim to follow Christ, but varieties of Christian groups deny they share the same faith.
Though Christianity is the largest religion in the world, it is also the most divided. The most prominent branches and denominations include the following.
Roman Catholicism
Worldwide Members:
 1.1 billion
Led by the Pope
 (the bishop of Rome), the Roman Catholic Church claims continuity with the earliest churches in the New Testament. Catholics attend a weekly Mass centered on the Eucharist, which they believe becomes the literal body and blood of Christ after being consecrated by a priest. Catholics tend to emphasize the role of Mary, believe in a temporary purgatory after death that helps purify souls for heaven, and propose that only the Catholic Church brings people to salvation in Christ.
Eastern Orthodoxy
Worldwide Members:
 260 million
Having split from the Catholic Church during the Great Schism of 1054, Eastern Orthodoxy also claims continuity with the earliest Christian believers. The majority of its adherents today live in Eastern Europe and Russia. It has no central authority or papacy beyond the interpretation of the scriptures by the Church’s ecumenical councils. Orthodox Christians value personal experience and freedom, and worship is very liturgical.
Protestantism: Episcopal/ Anglican (Church of England)
Worldwide Members:
 80 million
The Church of England, also known as the Anglican Church—or, in the United States, the Episcopal Church—dates back to the English Reformation in the sixteenth century, when the Church in England separated from Rome. Its modern adherents consider themselves a bridge between the Protestant and Catholic branches of Christianity. The Eucharist is central to worship, as is a collection of liturgies and church-service prayers called the Book of Common Prayer
Protestantism: Lutheran
Worldwide Members:
 70 million
The Lutheran tradition dates back to sixteenth-century Germany. Initially, Lutheran
 was a derogatory term used by Catholics to describe those aligning themselves with the “heresies” of Martin Luther. In its modern incarnation, Lutheranism ordains both men and women as pastors and tends to be more liturgical in worship—though less formal than Catholics, Orthodox, or Episcopalians.
Protestantism: Reformed/ Presbyterian
Worldwide Members:
 80 million
Deeply influenced by the teachings of John Calvin and his acolytes, the Presbyterian Church has its roots in the Church of Scotland and one of its prominent leaders, John Knox. The denomination is organized around the presbytery
 —an administrative body of local churches working together. Presbyterians tend to focus on God’s sovereignty
 , or ultimate rule of the universe.
Protestantism: Methodist
Worldwide Members:
 80 million
An outgrowth of an eighteenth-century revival movement in the Church of England, this denomination began with the teachings of brothers John and Charles Wesley. They emphasized personal piety—prayer, fasting, Bible reading, and the individual expression of faith lived by a set of principles, or “methods.” Modern Methodism includes a variety of worship styles and encompasses several organizations, including the United Methodist Church, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, the Wesleyan Church, the Church of the Nazarene, and the Salvation Army.
Protestantism: Pentecostal/Charismatic
Worldwide Members:
 280 million
This worldwide movement emerged from evangelical Protestantism in the early 1900s and emphasizes the personal experience of God through the Holy Spirit. Pentecostals tend to be more focused on divine healing, prophecy, speaking in tongues, and other spiritual occurrences than most denominations. Worship is spontaneous, exuberant, and very casual. Pentecostal and Charismatic denominations include the Assemblies of God, Calvary Chapel, and Vineyard Churches.
Protestantism: Baptist
Worldwide Members:
 72 million
Baptists are named after their belief that baptism must take place after conversion (rather than during infancy) and must follow the New Testament example of full underwater immersion (rather than sprinkling or pouring). The Baptist church emerged among Protestants in Europe in the seventeenth century. In 1845, the Southern Baptist Convention split from other American Baptist churches over issues concerning slavery, eventually becoming the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. In 1995, it apologized for “condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism” and renounced its racist roots.
Protestantism: Seventh-day Adventist
Worldwide Members:
 18 million
This Protestant denomination emerged from an end-times movement in the nineteenth century and adheres to most evangelical Protestant teachings, differing mainly in its observance of Saturday—rather than Sunday—as the biblical day of worship and rest. The term Adventist
 comes from the denomination’s emphasis on the Second Coming, or advent , of Jesus Christ. Seventh-day Adventists tend to adopt vegetarianism and healthy eating, with many following the kosher laws (see here
 ) of the Old Testament.
Protestantism: Restoration (Church of Christ, Disciples of Christ, Christian Church)
Worldwide Members:
 7 million
An American religious movement that arose during the Second Great Awakening in the late eighteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries, the Restoration Movement was a campaign against the division of Christianity into a multitude of denominations. Its founders intended to restore a unified church like the one depicted in the New Testament. Eventually the movement broke into a variety of groups, including the more conservative Churches of Christ (many of which prohibit instruments of music in worship services) and the more progressive Disciples of Christ.
Latter-day Saints/Mormons
Worldwide Members:
 16 million
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has redefined central doctrines such as the Trinity and introduced distinctive beliefs and practices. Members of the church (who are frequently called Mormons) consider themselves Christians and their church the restoration of the original New Testament church. Founded by Joseph Smith after a series of visions beginning in 1820, this religion follows the teachings of the Bible in addition to the Book of Mormon
 and other writings. Among other unique doctrines, these teach baptism for the dead and exaltation
 , a process of eternal progression, which allows humans to have families and become gods in the afterlife.
Jehovah’s Witnesses
Worldwide Members:
 8 million
Like those of the Latter-day Saint movement, the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses diverge from traditional Christian teaching, though members consider themselves the restoration of the original first-century Christian church. This movement began in the late 1800s with an Adventist-inspired pastor named Charles Taze Russell, who stressed the Second Coming of Christ. Jehovah’s Witnesses believe Jesus is God’s son, but also a created being separate from and inferior to God, as opposed to an equal member of the Holy Trinity. Another noteworthy practice is the refusal of blood transfusions, based on an interpretation of Old Testament laws.
OTHER NOTABLE CHRISTIAN GROUPS
 Other well-known Christian denominations or sects include the Mennonites (1.7 million worldwide), Plymouth Brethren (1 million), Unitarian Universalists (600,000 members), Quakers (400,000 members), and Amish (250,000 members).
A BELIEF SPREADS
Christianity arose among Jews in Israel who believed Jesus was the resurrected Messiah. Proclaiming the gospel, or “good news,” of Jesus became central to the faith, and new converts sought to produce other converts.
Paul of Tarsus, a strict follower of Judaism, was one of these new believers. A little more than a decade after the death of Christ, he experienced a rapturous vision of Jesus that drew him into the new faith. Between around 44 and 63 CE, Paul traveled through Asia Minor, Greece, and Rome proclaiming the message of Jesus.
The faith spread slowly throughout the Roman Empire in the three centuries that followed. However, the ruling Romans declared Christianity illegal and executed many new Christians, until Constantine the Great legalized the faith in the early fourth century. Afterward, Christian missionaries spread into Western Europe, Northern Europe, and the British Isles, establishing churches and small communities of believers among the pagan civilizations. During the Middle Ages, the Christian faith replaced ancient beliefs throughout Europe.
New missionary activity bloomed again with the discovery of the New World in the late fifteenth century. Catholic missionaries traveled to Central and South America alongside the political powers who took over the land in a quest to convert native people groups to Christianity. Protestants fleeing persecution in England arrived in North America. The colonization of India and Africa brought Christianity to those regions in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as did missionary activity in China and Southeast Asia.
By the twentieth century, almost every people group in the world had been exposed to the Christian faith, and Christianity had become the world’s most dominant religion. Even though its reign may be declining in the developed world, the faith continues to expand in developing nations—especially throughout the Southern Hemisphere.
INTO THE FUTURE
Just as Christianity deepened, changed, and spread in the centuries following the crucifixion of Jesus, it continues to transform today. The world’s fastest-growing religion during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Christianity became the dominant religion in wealthy, industrialized countries. But as fertility rates in those countries have dropped, so has the spread of the faith. In the Western world today, Christianity is declining.
In 1910, more than 60 percent of the world’s Christians lived in Europe. A 2015 Pew Research Center study estimates that by 2050, Europe will be home to only 16 percent of the world’s Christians. A separate 2015 Pew study revealed that the number of American adults identifying as Christian fell eight percentage points over the previous seven years. During that span, the number of religiously unaffiliated Americans grew by nearly the same amount.
Though the Christian faith may be declining in the Northern Hemisphere, it is flourishing in developing nations. Experts speculate that by 2050, nearly 40 percent of the world’s Christians will be residents of sub-Saharan Africa. However, the rapid expansion in Africa may not be enough to keep Christianity at the top of the list of world religions. The fastest-growing religion in the world today is Islam—a religion boosted by substantial youth populations and the world’s highest fertility rates. If current trends continue, Islam may replace Christianity as the most populous religion in the world within fifty years.ISLAM
Islam is the world’s fastest-growing faith and, behind Christianity, the second-largest religion. It has had a profound impact on human history. It’s the newest of the three most popular monotheistic religions (along with Judaism and Christianity), and often the least understood by outsiders.
One of the biggest misconceptions involves Islam’s relationship to those two ancient faiths in particular. Though current events and the Western media have led many Westerners to mistake Muslims as sworn enemies of Christians and Jews, the three faiths actually share a common heritage. All three began in the Middle East. All three believe God revealed his word to humanity through chosen prophets. All three revere biblical figures such as Noah, Abraham, and Moses (though the Arabic versions of these prophets’ names are different from the versions English speakers are used to). Muslims even honor Jesus, whom they call Isa
 , as a great prophet sent from Allah. Likewise, Allah is believed to be the same deity as the God worshipped by Jews and Christians.
Muslims believe in bodily resurrection, a coming day of judgment, a spiritual realm filled with angels and demons, and an afterlife divided between heaven and hell. Despite their shared history, Islam teaches that it is a purer religion than Judaism and Christianity, and that the revelation given to the prophet Muhammad was God’s final, uncorrupted word to humanity. In the most general terms, this worldwide religion is based on submission to the will of Allah.
DIVINE REVELATION
In the late sixth century CE
 , the mostly nomadic tribes of the Arabian Peninsula practiced polytheism, despite the presence of a few Christians and Jews in the region. The city of Mecca—now part of modern-day Saudi Arabia—was home to a sacred shrine known as the Kaaba
 . Purportedly built by the prophet Ibrahim and his son Ismail, this cube-shaped stone structure was dedicated to Hubal, a local deity. Worshippers considered Hubal the greatest of the 360 different idols contained within the shrine.
During this time, a boy named Muhammad was born in Mecca. Orphaned as a small child, he was raised by his uncle and, though illiterate, he grew to become a wealthy merchant.

 Quran
Muhammad was spiritually curious and began to meditate and pray regularly at Hira, a small cave on Jabal al-Nour, a mountain near Mecca. According to tradition, in the year 610, when Muhammad was forty years old, a supernatural being appeared to him one night. The being revealed itself to be the angel Jibril and gave Muhammad a divine revelation, which, among other things, included the first verses of the Quran and the instruction to proclaim that Allah
 —Arabic for “the God”—was the supreme God and worshipping any other deity was a great sin. Muhammad continued to receive revelations from Allah for the next twenty-two years.
Almost immediately, Muhammad began to preach the message of Allah to the people of Mecca. At first, he was ignored, but gradually, he began gaining a small number of followers—mostly family members—and as that number grew, Muhammad encountered opposition. After all, Mecca attracted a steady stream of pilgrims who worshipped the idols in the Kaaba, and Muhammad’s insistence on monotheism threatened the city’s rulers and economy. The death of his powerful uncle in 619 exposed Muhammad to more intense persecution and aggression. In 620, Muhammad had another mystical encounter: a night journey on a flying horse during which Jibril took him to Jerusalem, then carried the prophet to heaven, where he met Ibrahim, Musa, and Isa.
In 622, to escape an assassination plot, Muhammad and his followers migrated from 
 Mecca to Yathrib, a city 250 miles north, which later was renamed Medina. This escape is known as the Hijra
 , and Muhammad went to work converting Medina to monotheism, making it the first community ruled by sharia
 , or Islamic law. The Islamic calendar begins with the Hijra in 622. As Muhammad’s followers grew, they embarked on several violent clashes with the population of Mecca until, finally, Muslims captured Mecca in 630. Muhammad destroyed the idols kept in the Kaaba, announced that monotheism would replace idolatry in Mecca, and offered amnesty to his enemies. Muhammad died in 632 after a prolonged sickness, possibly from complications related to an attempted poisoning a few years earlier. By this time, Islam had been established as the primary religion across the Arabian Peninsula.
To those outside the faith, it might appear as if Islam didn’t begin until Muhammad’s first revelation in 610, making it a new religion based on a new scripture, the Quran. To Muslims, however, Islam is not a faith that began in the seventh century, but rather a revelation of the undefiled truth of Allah meant to repair and transcend the mistakes of Judaism and Christianity.
THE STAR AND CRESCENT
Once a symbol of the widespread Ottoman Empire, the star and crescent dates back to a number of ancient cultures—from the Middle East to Asia—who considered the elements of the night sky to be sacred. For centuries, Islam rejected the use of icons to represent the faith, just as it rejected visual depictions of Muhammad or Allah (see sidebar here
 ). But after the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early twentieth century, its predominantly Muslim successor states began to adopt the star-and-crescent symbol in their flags. By the mid-1900s, it had developed into a worldwide symbol of Islam.
MAJOR FIGURES
The most prominent figures in Islam include the early prophets, Muhammad and his immediate successors, scholars and influential imams, and modern political leaders.
Muhammad
Muhammad was Allah’s final prophet in a lineage that includes Isa, Ibrahim, and the first man, Adam. In this role, Muhammad—also known simply as “the Prophet”—received the sacred teachings of the Quran directly from the angel Jibril. Muslims do not worship Muhammad but revere him as the man Allah chose as his vessel.
Nuh
Nuh (known in English as Noah) was one of the earliest prophets sent by Allah to save a sinful world. He is praised in the Quran for building the ark and preaching the worship of Allah despite being mocked. Nuh and a group of believers (which did not include his wife and eldest son), as well as two of each type of animal (male and female), survived the Great Flood by taking shelter in the ark.
Ibrahim
Ibrahim (known in English as Abraham) was the first Muslim as well as the great patriarch of Judaism and Christianity. Traditionally, Abraham purified Arabia of idolatry and, with his son Ismail, made the first pilgrimage to Mecca in obedience to Allah’s command. There he rebuilt the Kaaba—which had been destroyed during Noah’s flood—and instituted monotheism.
Musa
Another great prophet, Musa (known in English as Moses) was sent by Allah to the idolatrous rulers of Egypt. Allah gave Musa miraculous abilities to demonstrate the power of the one true God, and revealed the Ten Commandments to him on Mount Sinai. Muslims consider the lives of Musa and Muhammad to have many parallels, and Musa is mentioned in the Quran more frequently than any other prophet.
Isa
Isa ibn Maryam (or Jesus, son of Mary) was a prophet who was brought to earth to communicate the message of Allah and given the ability to perform miracles. Although Muslims believe that Isa was divinely conceived, they do not believe that he was the son of God. They also do not believe that he died as a result of crucifixion, but rather that Allah “raised him to himself” (that is, he ascended into heaven). Isa was the last prophet sent to guide the Israelites and foretold the coming of Muhammad.
Zaid
Zaid was an early companion of Muhammad and one of the first converts to Islam. Considered an adopted son of the Prophet, he became Muhammad’s personal scribe, writing down the verses of the Quran that had been dictated to Muhammad by Jibril. After Muhammad’s death, Zaid collected the Prophet’s spoken teachings and written revelations into a single authoritative manuscript.
Abu Bakr
A companion of Muhammad, Abu Bakr became the first caliph , or political leader of an Islamic state. He was one of Muhammad’s fathers-in-law and the first male adult outside the Prophet’s immediate family to convert to Islam. Abu Bakr accompanied Muhammad during the Hijra and was the first to inform Muhammad’s followers of his death. He was elected to succeed Muhammad, becoming the first of the four Rashidun
 , or Rightly Guided Caliphs, and ruled from 632 to 634. A minority of Muslims disputed his replacement of Muhammad, believing his cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib should have become caliph instead. This group went on to splinter into the Shia branch of Islam.
Umar ibn al-Khattab
Umar ibn al-Khattab was an advisor to Abu Bakr, an early convert to Islam, and the second of the Rightly Guided Caliphs following Abu Bakr’s death. Umar opposed Muhammad’s teachings, until he read an excerpt from the Quran and immediately declared theshahada
 , the Muslim proclamation of faith. His daughter became one of Muhammad’s wives. A gifted military commander, Umar ruled from 634 until 644 and oversaw a significant expansion of Islam through conquest. He died after being stabbed by a captured slave during prayer.
Uthman ibn Affan
The third of the four Rightly Guided Caliphs, Uthman ibn Affan was a wealthy aristocrat from Mecca who was one of Muhammad’s first converts. He gave much of his wealth to help the poor and is known for having commissioned Zaid, Muhammad’s companion, to compile the authoritative, written Quran still used by Muslims today. Uthman’s wife abandoned him after his conversion, so he married two of Muhammad’s daughters, in succession. Both preceded him in death. Uthman was the caliph from 644 to 656, when he was assassinated after a twenty-day siege on his home by Muslim dissenters who believed Ali ibn Abi Talib should be caliph.
Ali ibn Abi Talib
Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law, and the last of the four Rightly Guided Caliphs, Ali ruled from 656 to 661 but believed Muhammad intended him to succeed him originally in 632, rather than Abu Bakr. This made Ali a central figure in a civil war that led to the Sunni/Shia schism. Those who became Sunni Muslims believed Muhammad wanted his successor chosen by the community. The dissenting Shia Muslims believed Muhammad wanted his successors to come from within the Prophet’s family, and they backed Ali during the reign of each of the prior caliphs. Though both groups respected Ali 
 and pledged to support him after the death of Uthman, his reign didn’t heal the schism: Ali was eventually fatally stabbed by a Kharijite assassin. Shias consider Ali to have been the first imam
 , or prayer leader.
Fatima al-Zahra
Fatima al-Zahra was one of Muhammad’s daughters and the only one to bear children and extend the family lineage. She was close to her father, occasionally defending him during early Muslim persecution in Mecca, and married Ali, the Prophet’s cousin. She died not long after her father. Many Muslims hold her in as high regard as Catholic Christians hold Mary. Shias believe that as the wife of the first imam, Fatima was sinless and infallible—immune to error—as were Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. This group is collectively known as the Fourteen Infallibles
Twelve Imams
In Shia doctrine, the Twelve Imams
 are the political and spiritual successors of Muhammad, with Ali ibn Abi Talib as the first. Ten of the twelve were descended from Ali and Muhammad’s daughter Fatima, and they were believed to have been specially guided by Allah to teach the true message of Islam. The last of the twelve, Muhammad ibn Hasan al-Mahdi (the “Hidden Imam”), is a messianic figure who is believed to be still alive, waiting to return as the savior of humanity. Along with Isa, he will someday return to establish Islam worldwide, bringing peace and justice to every nation.
Rumi
Rumi was a thirteenth-century Persian poet and influential Sufi mystic whose works remain some of the most popular and widely translated poetry in the world. Also a prominent Muslim scholar, Rumi often used his poetry to praise the Quran and the path of Muhammad. At the same time, his musings on more universal themes like joy, love, inner transformation, and the sacredness of life have captured the attention of readers worldwide, regardless of religion. In fact, he may have introduced more Westerners to the values of Islam than anyone else in history.
Muhammad Ali Jinnah
A Shia Muslim who grew up in India, Muhammad Ali Jinnah was educated as a barrister in England, and led the All-India Muslim League political party in India for decades. Alongside the influential Muslim poet and philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, Jinnah was instrumental in founding the nation of Pakistan in 1947 as a home for Indian Muslims separate from the rest of India. He led the new nation until his death in 1948. While he is viewed negatively in India, Jinnah is honored as the greatest leader in the history of Pakistan.
Ayatollah Khomeini
A charismatic twentieth-century politician and religious leader, Ruhollah Khomeini led the Iranian Revolution and founded the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979. A Shia Muslim, Islamic law expert, and author, Khomeini 
 became the Grand Ayatollah—the highest Shia authority after the Quran and prophets. Some Muslims regard him as a popular Islamic revivalist who attempted to bridge the divide between Sunni and Shia Muslims. In the West, he is seen with less admiration, due to his defiance of democracy, his role in the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, his insistence that the United States was the “Great Satan,” and his human-rights violations. He led Iran until his death in 1989.
MAJOR TENETS
In Arabic, the word Islam
 means “surrender.” Personal submission to the will of Allah is at the heart of the faith. Despite the significant divide between Sunni and Shia Muslims, most Muslims share the following foundational beliefs.
Creation
As in the Jewish and Christian creation accounts, the Quran states that Allah created the universe over six days. He created the first humans, Adam and Eve, from a mixture of earth and water before placing them in a heavenly paradise. Allah commanded the angels to bow down before the humans, but one—the jinn Iblis—disobeyed. Iblis, also known as Shaytan
 , then tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit. Allah forgave Adam and Eve for the transgression, but cast Iblis and the first humans out of paradise, sending them to earth. Iblis hated humanity and vowed to spend the rest of his days tempting humans to rebel.
Deity
Allah is the supreme God. In Arabic, Allah
 means “the God,” and Muhammad’s monotheism set his teachings apart from the polytheism of Arabian culture. Because Islam and Christianity both trace their origins to the Old Testament monotheistic beliefs of Abraham/Ibrahim, Allah is not a separate deity from the Judeo-Christian God. In fact, early pre-Islamic Christian communities in the Arabian Peninsula used the name Allah to refer to their God. Muslims view Allah as the omnipotent creator of the universe.
Prophets
Over the centuries, Allah has communicated to humanity through rusul
 —human messengers or prophets elected to deliver his message. The Quran mentions twenty-five different prophets by name, including Adam, Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham), Yaqub (Jacob), Musa (Moses), Ilyas (Elijah), Isa (Jesus), and the final prophet, Muhammad.
Scriptures
The holy scripture of Islam is the Quran, a written compilation of God’s direct revelations to Muhammad via the angel Jibril. The process of revelation took place over two decades and was passed down orally before being collected in a single book after Muhammad’s death in 632. Muslims regard the Quran as the word of Allah. Second in authority to the Quran are the hadith
 , Muhammad’s sayings on a variety of issues, 
 gathered several centuries after his death. Sunni and Shia Muslims accept different collections of hadith as authoritative. The Quran mentions three other sacred books: the Tawrat (Jewish Torah), the Zabur (possibly the Old Testament Psalms), and the Injil (a gospel revealed to Isa by Allah), all of which were revealed by Allah but corrupted in their understanding.
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS?
 While Muslims recognize Musa/Moses as a prophet, they do not follow the Jewish/ Christian Ten Commandments as written or accept them as authoritative. The Quran does, however, have its own version of commandments or instructions that parallel them, which are found in the Quran (6:151–152).
The Five Pillars of Islam
The Five Pillars of Islam are viewed as the foundational acts of i badah
 , or worship—in other words, the minimum religious obligations of a Muslim. These five principles are shahada
 (profession of faith), salat
 (daily prayer), zakat
 (almsgiving), sawm
 (fasting during Ramadan), and hajj
 (pilgrimage to Mecca).
SHAHADA
The shahada
 is a public confession, recited aloud to at least two fellow Muslims, acknowledging the distinctiveness of Allah and Muhammad: There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah
 . If said with sincerity, this proclamation is all that is necessary for conversion to Islam and must be made at least once in a Muslim’s life.
SALAT
Devout Muslims worship Allah and proclaim his greatness with salat
 , or prayer, five times every day: at dawn, at noon, at midafternoon, at dusk, and in the evening. In Islamic communities, Muslims are led by a prayer leader known as a muezzin
 , whose voice is broadcast from the minaret
 , or tower, of a local mosque. While Muslims can pray anywhere, they are expected to face in the direction of Mecca during prayer. Public buildings in many Muslim countries post signs indicating this direction.
ZAKAT
Caring for those in need is central to Islam. Muslims believe generosity is an act of gratitude received by Allah as a form of worship, and zakat , or almsgiving, is one way to do that. Often zakat is calculated as a percentage of income or assets—traditionally 2.5 percent, given to special zakat collectors associated with the mosque. In some Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, almsgiving is treated as a mandatory tax regulated by the government.
SAWM
Sawm
 is the practice of fasting, particularly during the holy month of Ramadan, the ninth month in the Islamic calendar. Able-bodied 
 Muslims are expected to give up food, drink, and sexual relations from dawn to dusk. They begin each day’s fast with a small meal before sunrise and break the fast with a larger meal at sunset. The purposes of the fast are spiritual purification and to build restraint, discipline, and empathy.
HAJJ
All adult Muslims who have the financial means are expected to make a pilgrimage, or hajj
 , to the holy city of Mecca at least once in their lifetimes. This pilgrimage should be performed after Ramadan during the twelfth month of the Islamic year. Most men wear special, seamless white robes to help achieve a purified state called ihram
 , while women wear white clothing or attire traditional to their home country. Hajj involves several purification rituals over five days, including circling the sacred Kaaba monument seven times. With more than three million people participating each year, the hajj has become the largest regular gathering of people in the world. The surging waves of worshippers have often caused mass-trampling deaths, including a 2015 stampede that killed nearly 2,500 pilgrims.
Six Articles of Faith
In Islam, these six articles are the metaphysical elements of Islam that Muslims must accept as part of iman
 , or faith: belief in Allah, belief in angels, belief in the divine books, belief in the prophets, belief in the coming judgment and resurrection (or the afterlife), and belief in Allah’s foreknowledge and supreme will.
The Soul
Allah created the physical body of humans and then breathed the soul into them. Considered pure at birth, the eternal soul separates from the body at death, awaiting the final judgment, when it will be rewarded with paradise or cast into punishment in the afterlife.
Afterlife
The Quran teaches that, at the end of time, the deceased faithful and all jinn will be resurrected before the destruction of the world (Yawm ad-Din
 , or the Day of Judgment). At this time, Allah will judge everyone according to their deeds. Those found worthy will spend eternity in a paradise known as jannah
 (Arabic for “garden”), where their every wish will be fulfilled. This paradise has several levels, the highest of which is reserved for prophets and martyrs.
Those found unworthy—primarily non-Muslims who denied Allah, disobeyed his laws, and rejected his prophets—will be condemned to a hell-like realm of fire called jahannam
 . According to the Quran, sinners fuel the fires of jahannam, making it a place of intense physical and spiritual suffering. At the center of jahannam is the tree of Zaqqum, which produces a bitter, thorny fruit shaped like a devil’s head. When eaten, the fruit boils in the stomachs of sinners, causing extreme pain.
TO BE MUSLIM
 “Allah! There is no deity save Him, the Alive, the Eternal.” —Quran 2:255
Salvation/Liberation
Salvation is viewed as entrance to jannah
 (heaven), given to those who believe in Allah and Islam, and whose good deeds outweigh their sins. Islam rejects the Christian view of original sin as an automatic human state, identifying sins as specific acts of evil that require repentance and atonement.
Worship/Practice
The Five Pillars are the central acts of Islamic worship and practice. Muslims also follow sharia
 , the moral and religious law as described by the Quran and hadith. It covers a variety of topics including prayer, personal hygiene, and dietary rules. For instance, the Quran prohibits the eating of pork and the use of intoxicants. Many Muslim countries incorporate sharia into their legal systems, including mandatory punishments for particular crimes.
COMMON PRAYER-LIKE PHRASES
Muslims repeat a number of prayer-like phrases during their daily lives, including:
Allahu akbar:
 “Allah is the greatest.”
Subhanallah:
 “Glory to Allah.”
Alayhi-assalam:
 “Peace be upon him.” This is said after any reference to Muhammad or another prophet.
Inshallah: “If Allah so wills.” This is said when mentioning a future event or plan.
THE SUPERNATURAL REALM
Islam posits the existence of a realm of supernatural beings:
Iblis
 is the devil in Islam, a jinn who refused Allah’s instruction to bow to the first man, Adam, and was cast out of jannah
 (heaven). He and his minions now whisper deception into the hearts of both humans and jinn, enticing them to evil. He is also known as Shaytan
 —Arabic for the name Satan—and considered by many to be the father of all jinn.
Jinn
 are spirits made of smokeless fire who have free will, can interact with people, and, along with angels and the human race, were created by Allah. Some jinn are good, but some follow Iblis, making them equivalent to demons in the Christian tradition. Belief in jinn may date back to pre-Islamic Arabian tribes. The word genie
 is an Anglicization of the singular jinni
Malaika
 (angels) are made of light, and lacking free will, they must obey and serve Allah. Belief in angels is the second of the six Islamic articles of faith. Notable angels mentioned in the Quran include Jibril, who revealed the Quran to Muhammad; Mika’il, who is mentioned alongside Jibril as a messenger of Allah; Israfil, who will blow a trumpet at the last judgment to signal the end of time; and Azrael or Malak al-Maut (literally “the angel of death”), who returns souls to Allah. Jibril and Mika’il correspond to the archangels Gabriel and Michael of the Judeo-Christian tradition.
MAJOR TEXTS
Muslims believe Allah revealed his will to humanity through his word, which has been given to messengers like Muhammad. This word, in the form of the Quran, is the definitive holy scripture of Islam.
Quran
The Quran is a written compilation of the revelations delivered to Muhammad over a period of twenty-two years, beginning in 610 CE
 . Muhammad memorized these revelations and taught them to his followers until his death in 632. Soon after he died, the teachings of the Quran were assembled in book form, with 114 chapters (surahs
 ) and 6,000 verses. Surahs are classified as Meccan
 or Medinan
 based on which city Muhammad was in during the revelation.
Though Muslims revere the Jewish Torah and Christian Gospels, they believe these books were corrupted by errors. The Quran, however—as written in Arabic, which many Muslims believe to be a sacred language—is Allah’s final, undefiled revelation to humanity. It is the Muslim’s ultimate authority for faith and conduct.
Furthermore, Islam teaches that the compiled Quran, as revealed to Muhammad, is a copy of a literal book that exists in heaven, and treats every physical Quran—particularly those in Arabic—with great respect. The Quran can never be left on the floor, must always be kept at the top of a bookshelf, must rest at the top of any stack of books, and should be carried in a protective bag. Most Muslims do not handle the Quran until they have performed wudu
 , a ritual cleansing.
Tawrat, Zabur, and Injil
According to the Quran, three texts preceded it as Allah’s revelations to his prophets. These scriptures were then corrupted and wrongly understood by Jews and Christians. Despite this teaching, Muslims are taught to respect these divine books. Belief in them, alongside the Quran, is one of the six articles of faith accepted by Muslims. These scriptures include the Tawrat (known by Jews as the Torah), which Allah revealed to Musa (Moses) in a perfected form but which has been corrupted over the years into the Torah we know today. The Zabur was revealed to the prophet Dawud (David), and may be the same collection of hymns and songs of praise known to Jews and Christians as the Psalms. Finally, the Injil is a holy book revealed by Allah to the prophet Isa (Jesus), which Isa then delivered to the Jews. This “gospel” is viewed as being Isa’s message itself, not the New Testament Gospel accounts accepted by Christians, which Muslims consider to be imperfect accounts of that message.
THE PURE WORD OF ALLAH
Inside the Islamic faith, Muhammad is viewed as the final prophet in a line that extends back to the Jewish patriarchs. Though Allah revealed himself to the prophets who wrote the scriptures used by Judaism and Christianity, Muslims believe that humanity misunderstood and corrupted those revelations, adding elements that did not originate with Allah. While those earlier revelations are respected within Islam, they are not viewed as the pure word of Allah.
Sunna and Hadith
After the Quran, the Sunna is a secondary source of Islamic law based on direct teachings from Muhammad and descriptions of his way of life. These traditions are collected in hadith
 , or narrations of Muhammad’s sayings and deeds. The word hadith
 is often used interchangeably with the word sunna
 . These statements and practices are not considered the literal word of God, but are established teachings that carry great weight and give Muslims deeper insight into the practice of their faith. The times and recitations of daily prayers, for example, originate in hadith.
Hadith began to be compiled in the eighth century, generations after Muhammad’s death, and many of the Prophet’s statements were suspected to be forgeries. Scholars studied these and assembled several collections thought to contain the most authentic teachings. Sunni and Shia Muslims accept different hadith literature based on the perceived validity of those scholars’ compilations, resulting in variations of sharia between the two branches.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
While the Five Pillars of Islam are Islam’s most important practices, Muslims also participate in a variety of other rituals.
Leaders
In Sunni Islam, imams are religious leaders or scholars who lead prayers, officiate at weddings, and oversee Friday communal prayer services, called jummah
 , which take the place of the noon salat
 . Imams often teach the Quran or give sermons during jummah. In Shia Islam, imams are far more revered, beginning with Ali. Purportedly chosen by God as the spiritual successors of Muhammad, imams possess the same divine authority and expertise as the prophet’s direct lineage.
Houses of Worship
A mosque
 is the central structure of any Islamic community, used for education and worship. Mosques contain an interior prayer hall for the practice of salat
 , or ritual prayers. Every prayer hall contains a mihrab
 —a simple alcove or an elaborate niche—showing the direction of Mecca.
Religious Gatherings or Services
Muslims believe the five daily prayers are more spiritually beneficial when performed in community than when performed alone. When possible, Muslims gather in a mosque for these prayers, facing Mecca in parallel rows, segregated by gender. While salat is the primary reason Muslims gather in mosques, they are also used for study, teaching, and as community centers in places where Islam is not a majority religion. Worshippers must remove their shoes and perform wudu
 before entering a mosque.
DEPICTIONS OF MUHAMMAD
Though not explicitly forbidden in the Quran, Islamic tradition bans visual depictions of Muhammad, Isa, Ibrahim, and any other prophets. Why? Because the worship of Allah as the one true God is central to the faith, and any explicitly representational images might lead to idolatry. Over the centuries, Muslim art has often shown the prophet’s clothed body while leaving his face blank or cast in shadow.
Clothing
There are many different interpretations of the Quran’s rules about clothing. Most observant men cover the area between their navel and knees, while many observant Muslim women cover the head, neck, and chest; everything except the face and hands; or everything including the face. For women, the style of covering varies across cultures and ethnicities. In some communities, it’s a square scarf that covers the head and chest, often called a hijab
 , though that term also refers to modest dress more generally and can even refer to more complex theological ideas surrounding rules about modest behavior. In other communities, it could be something more extreme, like a full-body covering with a screened facial veil called a burqa
 . Regardless of style, hijab is, for many Muslim women, an important expression of religious identity.
Prayer Rugs
Muslims are required to perform salat
 —their daily prayers—in a clean area. Prayer rugs are traditionally used to ensure the cleanliness of the ground on which the person prays. These rugs are usually decorated and include a niche at the top, which is positioned to face toward Mecca. The rug is unrolled before prayer and immediately rolled up following prayer to keep it clean. It is considered disrespectful to step on a prayer mat in shoes.
Prayer Movements
During salat
 , Muslims perform specific movements tied to each recitation. Standing, bowing, kneeling, or touching the forehead to the ground all represent submission to Allah and add a physical, meditative component to the prayers.
Birth Rituals
Following a birth, the child’s father holds the baby so that his or her right ear is facing him and turns toward Mecca. He then whispers the Islamic call to prayer (the adhan
 , which includes a declaration of faith) in the baby’s ear so that the first words he or she hears are about Allah. Three to seven days after birth, the infant’s head is shaved in a ceremony called an aqiqah
 , which symbolizes the start of a new life clear of impurities. On this day, the child typically receives his or her name.
Circumcision
Muslims practice circumcision of their newborn sons. The circumcision ritual—known as khitan
 —is viewed as a symbol of the relationship between Allah and humanity. It is not mentioned in the Quran, but it is taught in several hadith. Muhammad himself was circumcised.
Prohibitions
Certain prohibitions are expected of all devout Muslims. The Quran forbids consuming pork and wine, the latter of which is understood to extend to alcohol and tobacco. Gambling and sexual activity outside marriage are also forbidden, as is usury—the charging of excessively high interest rates.
Music/Chants
While some Islamic sects, like the Sufis, use music to enhance their devotional practices, music is not an intrinsic part of Islamic worship. However, the Muslim calls to prayer by the muezzin, as well as the prayers of worshippers themselves, are chanted aloud and often have a musical quality.
Marriage Rituals
According to sharia, marriage is a contract between a man and woman, and the main requirement of a marriage is that both sign this contract in the presence of two Muslim witnesses. Either before or during the marriage ceremony, which takes place in a mosque, the husband offers a gift called a mahr
 —typically a sum of money or sometimes a ring—to the bride. The mahr is not a dowry but a mandatory gift for the woman’s use. She accepts, and then they recite Arabic wedding vows. While the Quran permits polygamy, the practice of one man marrying multiple wives has declined in recent years.
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
The most central Muslim festivals and holidays celebrate events in the life of Muhammad. They are based on the lunar Islamic calendar, which is several days shorter than the solar calendar, and as a result, the months and even the times of year during which these observances fall varies.
LAYLAT AL-QADR (JUNE OR JULY)
Laylat al-Qadr
 (the “Night of Power”) commemorates the first divine revelation given to Muhammad. Though the Quran does not mention the specific date, it typically occurs on one of the final nights of Ramadan, based on the particular branch of Islam. Some Muslims may spend the entire night studying the Quran, seeking forgiveness, and praying, often at a mosque.
EID AL-FITR (JUNE OR JULY)
Eid al-Fitr
 is one of the two most important holidays for Muslims; the other is Eid al-Adha. This is a joyful festival marking the end of Ramadan when people wear their best clothes, exchange cards and sweets, and light up their homes and businesses.
EID AL-ADHA (AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER)
This four-day “festival of the sacrifice” concludes the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in the final month of the Islamic calendar. Muslims often sacrifice a lamb, goat, or other animal to recall Ibrahim’s willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail to Allah. While Eid al-Adha is central to hajj, it is observed by Muslims worldwide, including those not undertaking the pilgrimage. In Western countries, some Muslims refrain from the public sacrifice or perform it privately in a slaughterhouse.
MUHARRAM (SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER)
Muharram
 is a ten-day festival marking the start of a new year. The final day, known as Ashura
 , is a day of fasting. Ashura is particularly important for Shia Muslims, who fast in mourning for the death of Imam Husayn, Muhammad’s grandson, in 680 during the Battle of Karbala.
MAWLID (LATE NOVEMBER TO EARLY JANUARY)
The commemoration of Muhammad’s birthday and a national holiday in most Muslim countries, Mawlid
 usually involves parades, feasts, and stories about the Prophet’s life.
DIVISIONS
Within a few years of Muhammad’s death, Islam found itself split between two branches as Muslims disagreed about who would succeed the prophet. These branches—Sunni and Shia Islam—remain its two primary factions. Other subdivisions have arisen in the wake of that split.
Sunni Islam
The majority of Muslims worldwide are Sunni, and trace their heritage to the believers who supported Abu Bakr as the first caliph to succeed Muhammad. Their name derives from the Arabic word sunna
 , which means “path,” because they believe they are following the path exemplified by the Prophet. Most estimates claim that 85 or 90 percent of Muslims are Sunnis, which equates to a population of around 1.4 billion people. That makes Sunni Islam the world’s largest religious sect. (Roman Catholicism is the next largest with 1.1 billion adherents.)
Shia Islam
According to some Muslims, Muhammad intended his cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, to become the first caliph—not Abu Bakr. Though Ali eventually became the fourth caliph in succession after the Prophet, the dispute about Muslim leadership divided the fledgling community. Today, most Shias view Ali as the second most important figure in Islam after Muhammad, and refer to Ali and eleven of his descendants as the Twelve Imams
 —divinely placed spiritual leaders. Most of their practices are similar, though Shia Muslims sometimes combine the five prayers of salat
 into three daily prayers. Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, and Bahrain are Shia-majority nations, and large numbers of Shias live in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, often in separate neighborhoods from Sunnis.
Kharijites
This puritanical sect arose from a rebel group which assassinated Uthman ibn Affan, the third caliph after Muhammad. The name comes from a word meaning “exit,” because the group was viewed as having separated itself from Islam. The Kharijites opposed the diplomatic tactics Ali used to become caliph, and believed the caliph should be someone morally pure, no matter what background he came from, rather than someone who inherited the role. More moderate descendants of this group are prominent in Oman, with other surviving members in Zanzibar, Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya.
Druze
A secrecy-based sect that grew out of Shia Islam in the eleventh century, Druze is now considered a separate religion. Druze recognize the monotheistic traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam but believe their practice to be superior to all three. They have abandoned most of the rituals and requirements of Islam, believe in reincarnation, and do not reveal their religious books to anyone but special initiates. Most Druze live in Lebanon, Syria, and Israel, and they number around a million worldwide. Muslims do not recognize Druze as members of Islam.
Sufism
Sufism is a branch of Islamic mysticism that began in thirteenth-century Turkey. Its adherents pursue individual union with Allah based on a personal, loving relationship marked by asceticism and meditation. They use ecstatic rituals to draw near to Allah, chanting and dancing in order to enter a trance-like state, but they also follow standard Muslim practices like salat
 and fasting during Ramadan. One well-known form of physical Sufi meditation is the repetitive spinning performed by the “whirling dervishes” of a particular Sufi order in Turkey. Though the first Sufis emerged from Sunni Islam, Sufism has spread into Shia Islam as well.
Salafism
A conservative reform movement within Sunni Islam, Salafism emerged as a reaction against Western influence in the late nineteenth century. Salafists look to Muhammad’s conduct and practices as the Muslim ideal, endorse state-supported sharia, and reject any religious concessions to contemporary society. While the majority of Salafists avoid politics, some believe strongly in political activism and have risen to prominence in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Salafism has often  been associated with a small number of violent extremists practicing jihad
 (see here
 ) against perceived enemies of the faith. Salafism may well be the fastest-growing modern movement within Islam.
Nation of Islam
This American political and religious movement combines Islamic tenets with the goal of improving the civil rights of African Americans. The Nation of Islam was founded by Wallace D. Fard Muhammad in 1930 and rose to prominence through the activism of Elijah Muhammad (a disciple of the founder), Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan. Headquartered in Chicago, it has an estimated 50,000 members who follow the Five Pillars of Islam but also believe that Wallace D. Fard Muhammad—who disappeared in 1934—was both the Jewish Messiah and the prophesied Mahdi
 , or successor to Muhammad who will return before Judgment Day.
CREATION OR DESTRUCTION
Understanding the world created by Allah has long been intrinsic to Islam, making Islamic culture one of the world’s most lively sources of scholarship, invention, and creativity. While the Dark Ages gripped Western Europe, Islamic culture thrived in the Arabian Peninsula. Its mathematicians were the first to understand algebra and geometry, and they invented the Arabic numeral system used worldwide today. The Quran’s instructions to care for the sick led Arabic physicians to make great advances in medicine, from establishing hospitals to understanding the human circulatory, pulmonary, and nervous systems. Many modern surgical instruments originated with Muslim physicians. Islam also made immense contributions to navigation, astronomy, art, architecture, and machinery, and its scientists proposed a round earth 500 years before Galileo did. Because ritual cleanliness was so important to them, Muslims perfected soap and shampoo and introduced these inventions to the West.
As a monotheistic, Abrahamic religion, Islam has much in common with Christianity and Judaism, and it existed peacefully alongside the two ancient faiths for centuries. Any early Islamic violence was directed toward the polytheists of Mecca or splinter Muslim groups. But beginning with the Crusades and continuing through the modernization of Europe, many Islamic communities have found themselves in opposition to other faiths—and to the secularism of the West in general. As the West has grown more powerful, many Islamic clerics and reformers have begun to push against Western influence while emphasizing the supremacy of Islamic culture. In the process, they have begun to redefine a concept known as jihad
In Arabic, jihad means “struggle.” It refers to an individual’s sacred duty to fight against evil in the name of Allah. Jihad takes many forms, from jihad by sword (warfare) to jihad by speaking up against oppression or injustice. All of life is considered a form of jihad against sin. Muhammad himself once said that jihad in battle was much less important than spiritual jihad—the personal, internal struggle an individual wages against his or her own wicked tendencies.
But for a few extremists, the concept of jihad evolved into one that became militant and external. It became a means of retaining political power by toppling “immoral” Western-style rulers in order to establish governments founded on sharia. This mind-set fueled the Iranian Revolution in the late 1970s and the ascendancy of the Taliban in Afghanistan during the 1990s—along with the emergence of twenty-first-century militant terrorist groups like ISIS, al-Qaeda, and Boko Haram.
INTO THE FUTURE
Founded in the seventh century, Islam is far younger than most major religions, but it has grown exponentially throughout the Middle East and beyond. Today, Islam represents the fastest-growing religion in the world. Much of this has to do with high fertility rates in predominantly Muslim countries, but Islam is also a faith with a distinct focus on mission efforts.
Islam flourished in the Middle East until the powerful Ottoman Empire began to decline in the late nineteenth century. As the largely Christian culture of the West began to influence its long-standing traditions, Islam found itself at a crossroads. Many Muslims began to embrace Western political tactics, seeking to establish governments based on the teachings of Muhammad and the Quran. Others retreated to the fundamentals of the faith and began to fight, sometimes literally, against what they viewed as the corruptions of European and American religious culture. As a result, many of those outside the faith today view Islam through a lens tainted by terrorism and radical militancy.
Nevertheless, Islam remains a powerful, influential world religion. Its numbers will remain strong in the Middle East, North Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. But to increase its grip elsewhere in the world, it will have to fight against and ultimately free itself from the negative stereotypes created by its extremists.HINDUISM
Practiced by an estimated one billion people, Hinduism is the most ancient surviving religion in the world. Some of its traditional teachings, like meditation and yoga, are popular internationally. Yet Hinduism is far from a worldwide religion and doesn’t really resemble a single, unified faith.
More than nine out of every ten Hindus live in India, where Hinduism began and where it remains the national religion. With hundreds of gods and goddesses, dozens of authoritative scriptures, and no central authority, the faith is extremely diverse. It builds upon no single set of precise beliefs, creeds, or doctrines. There are no required rituals or practices. Though the deities Vishnu and Shiva are by far the most popular, devout Hindus are free to worship the god of their choice, at home or in a temple. For this reason, Hinduism can be difficult to grasp for those familiar with Western religions.
Because of this complexity, Hinduism has become one of humanity’s most vibrant religious traditions, rich with ornate temples, blue-skinned and multilimbed deities, mysterious painted holy men, colorful festivals, and exuberant dancing. Generally speaking, Hinduism describes the loosely connected faiths, philosophies, and ways of living that originated in India over the last four thousand years. Generally speaking, this complicated faith focuses on an individual pursuit of liberation from the cycle of life and death.
AN ANCIENT, ETERNAL FAITH
The word from which the name Hindu
 is derived doesn’t refer to a charismatic teacher or supernatural event. It is simply an ancient geographical term. It referred to people living beyond the Indus River, one of the longest rivers in Asia, which flows south through part of Northern India and into Pakistan. Hinduism referred to the beliefs of a specific people group—the Indian people. That’s why Hinduism is one of the oldest religions in the world and why its practitioners see their religion as eternal. To them, it simply has always been.

 The Vedas
Still, most scholars date the start of the Hindu religion to around 3,500 to 4,000 years ago, when Aryan cattle herders from Central Asia invaded what is now India. The agricultural people already living in the Indus Valley were more sophisticated than most civilizations and had ritual practices and beliefs of their own, including devotion to the phallic deity Shiva. The arrival of the nomadic Aryans brought another set of beliefs—including hymns and rituals known as the Vedas.
The traditions of both groups blended as the Indus Valley civilizations began to move southward, settling in the fertile region surrounding the Ganges River. During this period, written versions of the sacred traditions appeared, including the Rig Veda
 , which was composed between 1500 and 1200 BCE
 . Its more than one thousand hymns are the oldest religious scriptures in the world.
Other writings followed. Over the next thousand years, more writings joined the Vedas, including the Brahmanas (explanatory texts), Aranyakas (rituals), and Upanishads (teachings). The latter introduced the principle of reincarnation, explaining that the human spirit returns after death to begin a new cycle of life, in a new physical body, hoping to achieve perfection—and thus be freed from the cycle of life and death. That became the central goal of Hinduism and made the Upanishads one of its most influential texts.
As the civilization spread, Hinduism absorbed other indigenous religious traditions. Early Vedic deities like Brahma, the creator god, or Varuna, the god of the sky  and water, declined in popularity. A new set of deities replaced them, including Vishnu, Shiva, and Shakti. Eventually other faiths—Buddhism and Jainism—emerged from these traditions. Other variations arose in parallel.
Centuries later, Hinduism has evolved into a sprawling religion whose devotees worship multiple gods and perform a variety of personal rituals, but are not generally required to hold to specific, central doctrines.
MAJOR FIGURES
The leading personalities of Hinduism range from the legendary avatars of Vishnu to medieval Indian philosophers and mystics, culminating in Mahatma Gandhi and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the twentieth century.
Avatars of Vishnu
The four-armed protector god Vishnu is believed to reach into the four corners of the universe to hold it together. To do so, he often appears on earth in the form of an avatar
 —an animal, human, or other being in which a deity is incarnated. A number of the great figures of Hindu history were said to be human avatars of Vishnu, including Rama, the hero of the epic Ramayana
 and the seventh avatar of Vishnu; Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu who was a great soldier and lover; and even Siddhartha Gautama, the ninth avatar of Vishnu, who then rejected the concepts of Brahman and atman, sought enlightenment, and became known as the Buddha.
Adi Shankara
An influential philosopher and eighth-century reformer, Adi Shankara founded the school of Hindu philosophy known as Advaita Vedanta
 , which teaches that atman
 , the soul or inner self, is equal to Brahman
 , the highest reality. Shankara traveled throughout India to distinguish between Hinduism and Buddhism, establish monasteries, and advocate for the authority of the Vedas.
Abhinavagupta
Abhinavagupta was a late tenth-century proponent of Advaita Vedanta who was considered a master of Kashmir Shaivism , a Hindu branch in which followers worship the god Shiva. Abhinavagupta wrote the lengthy Tantraloka
 , a treatise on the philosophy and practice of Shaivism.
Ramanuja
A Tamil theologian and philosopher in the eleventh century, Ramanuja founded the Vishishtadvaita school of philosophy, which taught the underlying unity of the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita
 , and Brahma Sutras. He was an influential teacher within Vaishnavism, proclaiming personal devotion to the supreme god Vishnu. A social reformer, Ramanuja developed a reputation for ignoring the caste system
 —India’s socioeconomic classification system—and treating all people as equals.
Bhakti Saints
Representatives of the Bhakti movement, a Hindu devotional movement in India starting in the fifteenth century, the Bhakti saints
 advocated for spirituality regardless of caste or gender. These poets promoted personal morality and selflessness through hymns and music. Included among them were prominent historical figures like Chaitanya, Mirabai, and Tukarama.
OM/AUM
The most widely recognized symbol of Hinduism is the sacred sound om
 or aum
 . As written in the Devanagari script of India, it is one of the most common symbols in the ancient Vedas, as well as in today’s Hindu temples.
Ramakrishna
Ramakrishna was a nineteenth-century yogi and mystic who preached that all religious paths pursued the same ultimate reality, or Brahman
 . This made his message appealing to Indians who were being challenged by British Christian missionaries. Ramakrishna himself studied Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. He founded the monastic Ramakrishna order, and his disciples were essential in spreading modern Hinduism across the world.
Mahatma Gandhi
The devout Hindu leader of the Indian independence movement in the twentieth century, Mohandas Gandhi trained to be a barrister in London. He then spent two decades practicing law in South Africa, where he fought apartheid, experienced racial segregation, and earned the honorific title “Mahatma.” He returned to India in 1916 and began organizing protests of British oppression through satyagraha
 , or nonviolent resistance, using techniques like public hunger strikes to call attention to issues. He advocated on behalf of the “untouchable” caste, promoted the emancipation of women, worked to end poverty, and championed independence from Britain before being assassinated in 1948. His teachings inspired later reformers from Dr. Martin Luther King to Nelson Mandela.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was a prominent Hindu spiritual leader, born in India in 1917, who founded and popularized the Transcendental Meditation movement in the West. This mantra-based practice was purported to guide individuals toward a higher state of consciousness and introduced many to Hinduism. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s teachings attracted the attention of many celebrities and musicians in the 1960s and 1970s, including the Beatles. The Maharishi’s birth name was Mahesh Prasad Varma; Maharishi
 is a title derived from the Sanskrit word for “great seer.”
MAJOR TENETS
As a religious system, Hinduism lacks specific doctrines, but it is tied together by a few core tenets.
Creation
The Hindu scriptures offer more than one creation account. The oldest, in the Rig Veda
 , says all of life and the universe formed from the mind and body parts of a cosmic being called Purusha
 . A better-known version of the story holds that the universe ultimately sprang from Vishnu, who was floating in the ocean on Ananta Shesha, a coiled, multi-headed cosmic serpent. As he lay there, a glorious lotus grew from Vishnu’s navel, and Brahma sat within it. Brahma, the creator, then divided the lotus into three parts—the heavens, earth, and skies—before creating all the plants, creatures, and people living upon the earth.
TO BE HINDU
 “One should not behave toward others in a way which is disagreeable to oneself.” —Mahabharata
 , Anusasana Parva 113.8
Deities
All of creation is part of Brahman
 , a universal, unknowable force that is the origin of the universe. Brahman is pure intelligence and the ultimate reality. The gods and goddesses are personifications of Brahman. Three gods, known as the Trimurti —or the Hindu trinity—are the most renowned. These are Vishnu, the protector who embodies divine love; Shiva, the fearsome destroyer who takes away life only to re-create it; and Brahma, the creator god who provides a balance between Vishnu and Shiva. Certain schools of thought reject the Trimurti concept and instead identify Vishnu or Shiva alone as representations of the ultimate reality.
Ahimsa
Ahimsa is an absolute compassion, reverence for life, and commitment to nonviolence, found to various degrees within Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Resulting from a belief in karma and samsara (see here
 ), the Sanskrit word ahimsa
 is the opposite of himsa , which refers to causing injury. While there may be exceptions due to self-defense, a Hindu following ahimsa refuses to inflict injury, suffering, or any kind of violence on another living creature. Ahimsa is viewed as the highest expression of dharma
 , one’s personal moral duty.
THE REVERED COW
The virtue of ahimsa extends to animals. As a result, many Hindus practice vegetarianism and specifically do not consume beef. While the Hindu reverence for life covers all living creatures, cows have long been viewed as the most sacred animals since the writing of the religion’s earliest scriptures. The Vedas prized cows for the fertilizer they produced and the nurturing, maternal qualities of their milk. Krishna, a beloved avatar of the god Vishnu, was said to have tended cows as a child. Safe from slaughter, cows remain a prominent and visible part of life in India, where they walk the streets of its dense cities as protected animals.
Scriptures
Though there is no one holy book guiding Hindus, several Sanskrit texts are believed either to be divinely inspired or to have always existed. These include the four Vedas, including the 1,028 hymns in the oldest Rig Veda
 ; the Upanishads, ancient lessons establishing the ideas of Brahman and atman; the epic Mahabharata
 , known as the longest poem ever written; and the Bhagavad Gita
 , a dialogue about moksha that takes place within the Mahabharata
Karma and Samsara
Karma
 is the sum of a person’s actions throughout samsara
 , or the cycle of birth and rebirth. Good actions result in good karma and a favorable rebirth. Negative actions result in bad karma and unfavorable consequences in the next life. Though death may destroy a physical body, the inner self, or atman
 , survives—only to be born again in another form.
Moksha
Moksha
 is the desired liberation from samsara. One pursues it through devotion, meditation, prayer, self-knowledge, and the pursuit of dharma
 , one’s personal moral duty, over many lifetimes. To attain moksha is to escape the karmic cycle and achieve unity with Brahman.
IN PURSUIT OF MOKSHA
Journeys to particular shrines or sacred places are central to Hinduism and, though not required, are considered significant actions in the pursuit of moksha
 , or liberation from samsara. Many Hindus bathe in the sacred Ganges River, believing its water to be pure and capable of cleansing them of their sins. The river is said to be personified by the goddess Ganga. Varanasi, a city in Northern India alongside the Ganges, is considered the country’s spiritual capital, the home of Shiva, and another important site for pilgrimage. Other sacred sites include the birthplace of Krishna in the city of Mathura; the Badrinath Temple, a shrine to Vishnu in the Himalayan foothills; and the famed Meenakshi Amman Temple dedicated to Meenakshi (a three-breasted avatar of Parvati) and Shiva, in Madurai.
The Soul
Known as atman
 within Hinduism, the soul is thought to be an individual’s essence or true self—an eternal, ageless level of existence separate from the body and mind. Many schools of Hinduism identify atman as indistinct from Brahman, the universal force. Understanding atman, or self-knowledge, is essential to the practice of Hinduism.
Afterlife
Humans experience a cycle of lifetimes until they transcend karma and achieve moksha. However, between lifetimes, sinners may spend temporary periods in a hell-like realm of punishment called Naraka . Located south of the universe, Naraka is ruled by Yama, the god of death. All living beings—animals included—are brought to the court of Yama for judgment. The virtuous, the charitable, war heroes, ascetics, and those who attain moksha avoid punishment and are sent to a heaven-like realm called Svarga
 . Sinners are assigned to one of up to twenty-eight named hells, each of which applies a specific type of torment to compensate for a specific sin.
The End of Time
Hinduism teaches that creation is cyclical and that the world passes through endless cycles of destruction and rebirth with no beginning or end. Some believe that the god Shiva is constantly destroying and re-creating the world. Others believe that time consists of four cycles, or kalpas
 , each of which represents a day and night for Brahma. At the end of the fourth cycle, the final avatar of Vishnu will lead all deities in destroying the world’s evil, leading to the renewal of the first age and resetting of the sequence.
Worship/Practice
The practice of Hinduism is largely individual, based on meditation, prayer, and daily worship rites at household shrines. While these rites are sometimes practiced in temples, communal worship is not a prominent element of Hinduism.
MANY GODS
Like many tributaries flowing into a single great river, adherents of Hinduism believe in hundreds of different gods, all of whom are part of the universal force Brahman. Over the centuries, new deities have emerged, while others have been downgraded in importance. The three most significant are Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.
Brahma:
 The creator of the world and personification of Brahman, the absolute reality. Every time the world falls into ruin, according to its cycle, Brahma re-creates it anew. He is one of the three supreme gods in the Hindu Trimurti
 , or triad.
Vishnu:
 The preserver and protector, a dark blue, four-armed being who controls human fate and holds together the universe. To protect the world from evil, he occasionally enters the world in bodily form as an avatar. Hindu myths recognize ten avatars of Vishnu as especially powerful, including the fish Matsya (who saved Manu, the first man, from the great flood), the lion-man Narasimha (who fought the demon Hiranyakashipu), and Krishna. Vishnu is one of the Trimurti.
Shiva:
 The four-armed destroyer, surrounded by fire, who symbolizes the energy and potential of ultimate reality. Shiva has many attributes, but is known for destruction as well as for personifying the force of creation. He has a third eye on his forehead and is often represented by a phallus-like lingam
 , a cylindrical pillar often found in shrines or temples dedicated to Shiva. He is the third member of the Trimurti.
Krishna:
 An incarnation of Vishnu and one of the most popular Hindu deities. Some devotional movements identify Krishna as the supreme being. Others depict him as a little boy, a military hero, a herdsman, a trickster, or a highly sexualized divine lover. He typically has black or blue skin and wears a yellow loincloth.
Ganesh:
 A popular elephant-headed god revered as the patron of science, wisdom, writing, and intellect. Believing him to be the remover of obstacles, Hindus may invoke Ganesh before beginning any task. He is probably the most recognizable Hindu deity outside the religion.
Indra:
 A warrior-god, Indra rode on a white elephant, lived in the atmosphere, and carried a thunderbolt. He personified rain and thunderstorms and would arise each day to defeat the darkness. Indra was the most popular god of the earliest Hindus, around the time of the composition of the Rig Veda
Lakshmi:
 The female companion of Vishnu and a mother-goddess who represents wealth, well-being, fertility, and spiritual abundance. She is a favorite goddess of Hindu women and is usually depicted with golden skin and four arms, holding a lotus flower. For this reason, she is sometimes called Padma
 (Sanskrit for lotus) and may have evolved from early beliefs about Radha.
Radha:
 A Hindu goddess of beauty, kindness, and nature who is often depicted as the feminine counterpart to Krishna. In Vaishnavism, a branch 
 of Hinduism devoted to Vishnu, Radha is considered the representation of the human soul, while Krishna represents God.
Rama:
 An avatar of Vishnu and the protagonist of the Hindu poem Ramayana
 . The epic tells of a harsh journey during which he holds fast to dharma
 , or right living, despite many tests. Rama is revered as a paragon of virtue and morality.
Shakti:
 The female companion of Shiva, a mother-goddess who personifies the universe’s feminine creative force. Everything created will eventually be destroyed, and Shakti is viewed as the deity who energizes both creation and destruction. She is a fearsome goddess of great power who appears in many other forms, including Kali, Parvati, Annapurna, and Durga.
Varuna:
 The all-knowing king of the early Vedic deities, and god of the night sky, water, ocean, the undersea realms, and the supreme keeper of the cosmic laws. He saw every deed of humankind and was thought to punish sins. Eventually, Indra replaced him in popularity.
MAJOR TEXTS
The Hindu tradition divides its sacred texts into two categories: Shruti
 , “that which is heard,” which refers to revealed or eternally existing truth; and Smriti , “that which is remembered,” or realized truth. These scriptures were originally written in Sanskrit, the ancient sacred language of Hinduism.
The Vedas
The most ancient Shruti texts, the Vedas are the collected spiritual principles and teachings that form the foundation of Hinduism. Vedas
 means “knowledge.” There are four Vedas: the Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda
 , and Atharva Veda
 . Each is accompanied by an explanatory commentary called a Brahmana
 , writings on rituals and ceremonies called Aranyakas
 , and teachings called Upanishads
 . Most Hindus consider the Vedas divine revelations and the ultimate authority for Hindu prayer and worship. Scholars date their composition to before 1000 BCE
RIG VEDA
The most sacred of the four Vedas, likely composed between 1500 and 1200 BCE
 , is the Rig Veda
 . It contains ten separate books totaling 1,028 hymns to the ancient Vedic deities, including the hero god Indra. Its passages and prayers are often chanted in temple rituals. The Rig Veda
 represents the world’s oldest collection of sacred writings.
UPANISHADS
The fundamental texts of Hindu philosophy within the Vedas, the Upanishads are considered by many to be its most significant element. Central to the Upanishads are core teachings from mystics about Brahman
 (ultimate reality), atman
 (the soul or self), and moksha
 (release from the cycle of death and rebirth). The word Upanishads
 means “sitting near.”
MAHABHARATA
The Mahabharata
 is the longest known epic poem in human history, with more than 100,000 couplets and 1.8 million words. Its composition likely dates to the ninth or eighth century BCE
 , but it was not put into writing until several centuries later. Attributed to the sage Vyasa, it tells of a war between a family of brothers and the conflict between good and evil. The Mahabharata
 is considered Smriti
 , or realized truth.
BHAGAVAD GITA
A 700-verse poem contained within the Mahabharata
 , the Bhagavad Gita
 is the most revered of all Hindu writings. At its core is a conversation between Krishna (a deity and avatar of Vishnu) and the human Arjuna, prior to a battle. They discuss the importance of dharma
 (devotion), selflessness, and the pursuit of moksha
 (liberation).
Puranas
The Puranas are a vast collection of anonymous myths and legends about the gods and goddesses, stories about heroes and sages, and details of festivals and celebrations. These are divided into stories about Brahma, stories about Vishnu, and stories about Shiva. While the Vedas are used for prayers and rites, the Puranas are popular tales enjoyed by all Hindus.
Ramayana
An epic poem dating to the fifth or fourth century BCE
 , the Ramayana
 is attributed to the poet Valmiki. It tells the story of Rama and his journey to save his wife Sita after her abduction by a demonic king. Rama eventually recaptures Sita with the help of a monkey army. Along with the Mahabharata
 , the Ramayana
 is considered Smriti
 and is held to be one of the greatest works of Sanskrit literature.
THE KAMA SUTRA
If most Westerners recognize a single ancient Hindu text by name, it’s likely not the Bhagavad Gita
 or Rig Veda
 but the Kama Sutra
 , which was compiled by a Hindu philosopher who probably lived in the second century CE
 . Though popularly known as a sex manual—around one-fifth of it is devoted to sexual positions—the entirety of the text focuses on desire (kama
 ) as one of the four primary goals of life. (The others are dharma
 , or moral virtue; artha
 , work; and moksha
 , liberation. Of the four, kama is considered the least important.)
As such, the Kama Sutra is a guide to love, pleasure, and desire pursued in all aspects of life. Though it originally did not contain images accompanying the sixty-four sexual positions it describes, most contemporary versions of the Kama Sutra
 are illustrated.
Laws of Manu
 (Manusmriti
 )
The Laws of Manu
 , or Manusmriti
 , is a dialogue-based book of verse attributed to Manu, the first man in Hindu mythology. Considered Smriti
 , or realized truths, these texts instruct Hindus on moral conduct, rights, and social duties, including the caste system.
Yoga Sutras of Patanjali
A Sanskrit compilation of 196 aphorisms, assembled around 400CE
 , the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali
 are considered the foundational teachings for the practice of yoga. Widely translated in the Middle Ages, these texts all but disappeared between the twelftcountercultureh and nineteenth centuries. They returned to prominence in the late nineteenth century when the monk Swami Vivekananda reintroduced Hinduism and the practice of yoga to the Western world. In Sanskrit, sutra
 means “thread” and refers to a type of literary structure containing short proverbs that emerged from commentary on the Vedas. A number of ancient sutras have informed Hindus over the centuries, including the famed Kama Sutra
Gitanjali
 by Rabindranath Tagore
Gitanjali is a collection of 157 religious poems by Rabindranath Tagore, published in 1910 in Bengali, then in English in 1912. Translated by Tagore himself, the English publication of his poems earned him the 1913 Nobel Prize for Literature, making him the first non-European to receive this honor. Tagore’s poetry, novels, and other writings paid close attention to the concept of moksha and were highly influential worldwide.
Autobiography of a Yogi
 by Paramahansa Yogananda
Autobiography of a Yogi
 is a twentieth-century memoir by Indian-born Hindu Paramahansa Yogananda, who spent three decades as a yogi and guru in the United States. Among other things, he became well known for teaching a spiritual harmony between Christianity and Hinduism. Published in 1947, Yogananda’s memoir details his own search for enlightenment. It sold millions of copies in the 1960s and 1970s and introduced more Westerners to Hinduism than perhaps any other book.
Gandhi: An Autobiography
 by Mahatma Gandhi
In this classic autobiography of one of the most famous Hindus and social reformers of the twentieth century, Gandhi tells the story of his childhood, his adult life in South Africa, his imprisonment in India, his religious pursuits, and his philosophy about nonviolent resistance and Indian independence.
HINDUISM AND YOGA
The practice of yoga, which has been stripped of its spirituality in many parts of the Western world, began in India sometime around the sixth or fifth century BCE. Within Hinduism, yoga is a philosophical system that combines physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines to attain moksha
 , or release from the cycle of reincarnation. As a type of physical exercise, Western practitioners use yoga to encourage concentration and meditation while focusing on posture and breathing techniques.
Two main branches of yoga exist within Hinduism. The best known is hatha yoga
 , the physical postures of which are used in most Western yoga classes. Tradition holds that Shiva created this form of yoga. The lesser-known raja yoga
 focuses more on controlling the mind for meditation and spiritual enlightenment than on physical movements.
TRANSFORMATION OR DISCRIMINATION
Because it’s the oldest religion in the world, Hinduism’s core tenets have leaked into many other philosophical and religious systems. Its emphasis on nonviolence, humility, inner peace, renunciation of materialism, and meditation has been assimilated into multiple cultures. For instance, early American transcendentalists Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson were deeply influenced by Hindu philosophies.
Later, the faith’s teachings on self-consciousness and inner transformation played a significant role in the emergence of the 1960s counterculture in the West, which indirectly supported the sexual revolution, feminism, gay rights, environmentalism, and other movements. Yoga continues to be one of the most popular mental and physical disciplines today among people of all religious persuasions—or no religion at all—and Hindu tenets about karma and reincarnation have spread far beyond the religion’s practitioners
While Hinduism has had a noteworthy influence on modern culture, it also has a history rife with discrimination. The Purusha Sukta, a well-known hymn in the Rig Veda
 , tells of the creation of the world, during which the divine person was quartered into parts reflecting the four classes of people. This influenced historical Hinduism to divide humans into separate categories. The superior priestly class (Brahmans) was created from the mouth. The ruling warrior class (Kshatriyas) was formed from the arms. Merchants and farmers (Vaishyas) originated from the thighs, and the menial laborers and servants who made up the lowest class (Shudras) came from the feet. Members of another group, existing outside the class system altogether, were considered outcasts (Dalits).
Each class had different roles in society as they pursued their divine duty. This categorization, rooted in Hindu teachings, led to the Indian caste system. Hindus assumed that a person’s caste reflected past karma and dictated a person’s place in society at birth. These beliefs forbade the mixing of castes and, among other things, ensured male domination of society. While contemporary social and political movements have begun pushing against this system, the fact remains that it has contributed to centuries of discrimination, oppression, and the persistence of poverty in India.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
Hindus seek oneness with Brahman by studying the ancient texts, meditating, and praying. They also worship the gods of their choice at temples and at home, which represents the center of their religious lives.
Priests
During temple worship, a member of the Brahman priestly class will perform a ritual called puja
 for the temple’s deity. Puja includes rousing the god or goddess from sleep at the start of the day, bathing and dressing a representation of the deity, preparing the deity for food offerings, blessing food and sharing it with worshippers, reading from sacred texts, and singing or chanting to the deity before the day ends.
Household Shrines
Most homes have a household shrine containing a statue representing a deity. This figure is known as a murti
 and is believed to be an embodiment of the god or goddess. At this shrine, Hindus might offer praise, chant mantras, burn incense, study, meditate, wash the murti, adorn it with flowers, and/or offer food sacrifices. This daily practice, known as puja
 , is performed to honor the god or goddess and ensure good fortune and protection over the home and its residents.
TO BE HINDU
 “I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal toleration but we accept all religions as true.” —Swami Vivekananda
Religious Gatherings or Services
Because most Hindu worship occurs privately inside the home, public worship in temples is less formal, less structured, and less frequent (though in Western countries where Hinduism is practiced, communal religious gatherings may be more regular). Most of these sacred, palace-like structures are dedicated to a specific god and believed to be the deity’s earthly home. These ornate shrines are attended by priests and contain an image of the deity in the center of the structure. The faithful will visit a temple to request favors of the deity, make offerings, or attend religious festivals.
Public worship is largely a come-and-go affair taking place at various times of the day, but often includes puja rituals and ceremonies performed upon the temple’s murti by a priest. Visitors to a temple can sometimes request that a priest perform more elaborate puja rituals on their behalf.
Mantras
A type of prayer, mantras
 are sacred recitations that aid in meditation and put the worshipper in contact with the divine. These may be longer passages of Sanskrit text from the Vedas or single-syllable words such as om
 , a sacred sound and religious symbol encompassing ultimate reality and the soul that begins many hymns and ceremonial chants from the Vedas.
A COMMON CHANT: GAYATRI MANTRA
One of the prayers most representative of Hinduism is known as the Gayatri Mantra, which is recited or sung daily. It comes from the Rig Veda
 and was originally written in Sanskrit. Phonetically, it is pronounced:
Om
Bhuh Bhuvah Svah
Tat Savitur Varenyam
Bhargo Devasya Dheemahi
Dhiyo Yo nah Prachodayat
Over the years, it has been translated into English in a variety of formats. One of the earliest translations comes from eighteenth-century Indo-European linguist Sir William Jones: Let us adore the supremacy of that divine sun, the godhead who illuminates all, who re-creates all, from whom all proceed, to whom all must return, whom we invoke to direct our understandings aright in our progress toward his holy seat
Births
Several rites related to pregnancy and childhood are practiced by Hindus. In some traditions, these rites of passage, known as sanskaras
 , number in the dozens. One of the most significant is a private one known as jatakarma
 , performed by parents with a newborn baby. The father welcomes the child into the world by touching his or her lips or tongue with ghee
 (a purified butter believed to have divine qualities), while reciting mantras in the child’s ear. Other sanskaras include a naming ceremony, first haircut, and ear piercings.
Marriage Rituals
Weddings are colorful, celebratory affairs and have a significant role in Hindu life. While many traditions vary by family and region, most include a ritual in which the father of the bride gives his daughter to the groom. This is followed by the lighting of a sacred fire while the couple joins hands. The man and woman then recite seven vows to each other as they circle the fire. This is known as the saptapadi (“seven steps”) and is the central part of a Hindu wedding ceremony. Arranged marriages are common in India and Hindu culture, but are slowly decreasing in popularity.
RITES
 Hindu teachings classify rituals into three categories: nitya
 (daily rites at household shrines, see here
 ); naimittika
 (specific festivals or celebrations, see sidebar here
 ); and kamya
 (optional personal rites, like pilgrimage, see sidebar here
 ).
Sin
In monotheistic religions, sin is rebellion or disobedience toward God. Hinduism lacks an equivalent belief. Instead, the Sanskrit term papa refers to behaviors that create negative karma in the next life, or actions that do not align with one’s personal moral duty, or dharma
Repentance/Purification
Positive deeds, known as punya
 , are necessary to counteract papa
 , or negative actions. Punya
 may include helping the poor, giving to charity, performing daily rites in the home, or attending puja rituals at a temple.
DIVISIONS
Hinduism is a complex and wide-ranging belief system in which individuals are free to worship a diverse set of gods and goddesses. Though all adherents seek to attain liberation, they do so through participation in an equally varied set of beliefs, rituals, and traditions—many of which are centered on a particular deity. Modern Hinduism can be separated into four distinct sects, often illustrated as a lotus flower with four petals.
Shaivism
Shaivas worship Shiva as the supreme reality. Unlike the Vaishnava tradition, adherents of Shaivism are more likely to be ascetic and focused on self-purification, wearing ash on their foreheads as a sign of their devotion. Yoga plays a large role in this sect, as do temple rituals devoted to Shiva and the lingam
 (a phallic symbol). The stories of Shiva in the Mahabharata
 , the Ramayana
 , and the Puranas are significant scriptures.
Shaktism
Shaktism is a sect based on worship of the goddess Shakti and her many identities as the purest manifestation of the divine. It is closely related to Shaivism, due to the traditional belief that Shakti represents the feminine power of Shiva—who would not exist without Shakti. Shaktism teaches that all women are manifestations of the goddess, and is popular among women. Adherents often practice Tantric Hinduism, a system of rituals attempting to channel spiritual power and cosmic forces through the human body. Tantric meditation relies on holy diagrams called yantras
 to encourage focus, and is based on esoteric writings called theTantras
Smartism
A more progressive or nontraditional movement, Smartas believe that five or six particular deities—including Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, Ganesh, and Surya—are unified and equal personifications of supreme reality. Most Western Hindu practices fall into this category and tie back to the teachings of the eighth-century philosopher Adi Shankara. The Bhagavad Gita
 , Puranas, Ramayana
 , and Mahabharata
 are important scriptures in this nonsectarian tradition.
Vaishnavism
This tradition focuses on Vishnu as the Svayam Bhagavan
 —the absolute representation of the divine—along with Krishna, Rama, and his other avatars. Adherents are deeply devotional and practice frequent meditation and chanting. Vaishnava traditions believe the literal meanings of the scriptures are of greatest importance and draw heavily from the Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
Festivals and celebrations are a vital part of Hindu worship throughout the year. Many honor specific deities and take place according to traditional dates on the Hindu calendar.
SHIVARATRI (FEBRUARY OR MARCH)
A festival devoted to Shiva, Shivaratri
 is observed with fasting, a ritual bath, and puja dedicated to images of Shiva at dedicated temples. After an all-night vigil of hymns, devotees break their fast with a food offering.
HOLI (FEBRUARY OR MARCH)
A celebration of the Hindu New Year and beginning of spring, Holi
 recalls the fiery death of the demoness Holika at the hands of Narasimha, a half-human, half-lion avatar of Vishnu. Participation in this festival often involves nighttime bonfires, followed the next morning by a festival of colors in which adherents throw brightly hued powders and water on one another.
RAMA NAVAMI (MARCH OR APRIL)
This festival celebrates the birth of Rama, one of the most ancient human avatars of Vishnu. The faithful celebrate with songs, dances, and puja dedicated to Rama. It also marks the marriage date of Rama and Sita, and some temples reenact their marriage ceremony.
KRISHNA JANMASHTAMI (AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER)
Krishna Janmashtami
 is a festival celebrating the birth of Krishna, a popular deity and avatar of Vishnu. The faithful celebrate with songs, dances, and puja dedicated to Krishna.
NAVRATRI (SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER)
A festival that takes place over nine nights, Navratri
 remembers Shakti’s lengthy battle with demonic forces. It features worship of the goddess under her many identities, including Durga, Kali, Annapurna, and others. Festivities include dancing and devotional songs. Navratri culminates in Vijayadashami.
VIJAYADASHAMI (SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER)
This important festival falls on the last day of Navratri and celebrates the triumph of good over evil in the form of Rama’s victor over the demon Ravana and the victory of Shakti/Durga over the demonic Mahishasura. Traditionally the beginning of harvest season, it also includes rituals related to fertility and the soil.
DIWALI (OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER)
Also known as the “Festival of Lights,” Diwali
 is the most important Hindu festival. Participants dress in their finest clothes, light candles and lanterns to symbolize the victory of light over darkness, and offer prayers to Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and fertility. In some regions of India, Diwali festivals take place over several days.
INTO THE FUTURE
According to a 2010 Pew Research Center survey, India was home for 94 percent of the world’s Hindu population. By 2050, Pew predicts that 1.3 billion Hindus will reside in India. At the same time, India may also be home to the world’s largest populations of Muslims—311 million, or 11 percent of the world’s total. Religious violence is increasingly prevalent between these two faiths in India. How will these growth trends impact their already tumultuous relationship?
Though Hindus have remained mostly confined to India, a few of the religion’s concepts—meditation, yoga, and mindfulness—have filtered into the outside world. Despite this widespread recognition, Hinduism has not risen to the level of a worldwide religion like Christianity or Islam. The faith will surely continue to grow in India, where Hinduism is closely tied to national identity. But whether it will spread elsewhere and continue to gain influence worldwide are questions that can be answered only with the passage of time.BUDDHISM
Buddhism is based on relatively straightforward concepts: The Buddha taught that life is filled with suffering. Ignorance and desire cause that suffering. By eliminating ignorance and desire, humans can be released from suffering. That’s the simple core of this ancient belief system, which originated in India and has spread throughout the East to become the world’s fourth largest religion. However, that simplicity has given way to a prodigious array of numbered concepts: the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Three Jewels, the Four Sights, the Three Marks of Existence, and the Five Skandhas.
Buddhism has become an intricate faith that now exists in a variety of forms, seeming to shift and adjust as it encounters each new country and culture. The impermanence of the material world is central to Buddhism, and in many ways, that idea also applies to the ever-changing faith itself.
Initially, Buddhism evolved out of Hinduism, but denied that system’s belief in an unchanging soul. The Buddha, an ancient human teacher who attained enlightenment, rejected the idea of a supreme god and had little use for Hinduism’s countless deities. Instead he built a philosophy—indeed, some wonder if Buddhism should be described as a religion at all. His ethics were shaped by belief in the interconnectedness of all things and the importance of meditation and self-discipline. At the core of it all is the pursuit of a balanced Middle Way between luxury and austerity. That focus has made Buddhism a religion marked by peace, tolerance, and moral conduct that leads to happiness.
PURSUING ENLIGHTENMENT
Like several other religions, Buddhism traces its beginnings to India, where it emerged out of Hinduism and split into a separate belief system around the fifth century BCE
 . Siddhartha Gautama—upon whose teachings Buddhism was founded—was born into a wealthy ruling family near present-day Lumbini, Nepal, which is just north of the modern border with India.
Siddhartha’s father raised him in isolation, seeking to shelter him from the pain and suffering of the outside world. For years, Siddhartha remained confined to his father’s palace, even after marrying and having a son. However, he grew restless, and at the age of twenty-nine—with his father’s permission— he left the palace and had four life-changing encounters, known as the Four Sights

According to tradition, the first three sights were of an elderly man, a person suffering from sickness, and a dead body. His charioteer explained to the naïve prince that people grew old, got sick, and even died. This dismayed Siddhartha, who had never before experienced such things. Soon they came upon a fourth sight: an ascetic who seemed content despite his poverty.
Bewildered by these discoveries but inspired by the ascetic’s self-discipline and abstention, Siddhartha sneaked away from the palace for good, giving up his possessions and power. Leaving his family behind, he spent years living like the ascetic, begging and practicing yoga. He hoped this intentional deprivation would help him overcome the unending cycle of life and death. But this only left him weak, rather than enlightened. So Siddhartha turned to meditation. At the age of thirty-five, he sat with his back against the sacred Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India, vowing not to stand until he discovered the truth. After forty-nine days of deep meditation, Siddhartha finally achieved enlightenment. The fear of suffering left him. From this point, he became known as the “Enlightened One” or “Awakened One”—the Buddha
The Buddha began teaching the Four Noble Truths (see here ) to help humanity understand suffering, and the Noble Eightfold Path to help release humanity from suffering. He rejected the authority of the Hindu Vedas and taught that one could escape the karmic cycle of rebirth not via moksha, or liberation, but by reaching a state of nirvana
 —the pure absence of greed, suffering, and even personality. For the Buddha, ultimate reality was nothingness, achieved through human effort rather than the worship of deities.
His followers eventually separated from Hinduism entirely, steadily growing in number until the Indian emperor Ashoka embraced Buddhism in the third century BCE
 . Ashoka used his vast resources to send missionaries across the continent. From this point, Buddhism expanded quickly, and within centuries had blanketed Asia. Though it began in India and evolved from Hinduism, today Buddhism claims only a sliver of that country’s religious landscape.
MAJOR FIGURES
With less structure and far more diversity than most world religions, Buddhism lacks easily identifiable historical leaders. The influential people in this list include early philosophers, monks, and teachers, along with legendary, saint-like bodhisattvas.
Siddhartha Gautama
Siddhartha Gautama, born in India in the fifth century BCE
 , became the founder of Buddhism when, shocked by the suffering he encountered outside his father’s palace, he set out into the world and began seeking truth through meditation. He became the Buddha
 (“Enlightened One”) after reaching a state where he no longer feared suffering or death. He taught the Noble Eightfold Path as a “Middle Way” between asceticism and indulgence that could help his followers find release from suffering. While most scholars accept that the Buddha was a historical figure, there are no written records from his lifetime and his biographical details are impossible to verify.
Sangha
Once used to describe the first early followers of the Gautama Buddha, the term sangha
 now refers primarily to members of the Buddhist monastic community. Buddhist monks seek a life of devotion and meditation, and are tasked with teaching Dharma
 —the message of the Buddha—to others.
Mahakasyapa
One of the earliest disciples of the Buddha, Mahakasyapa is said to have attained enlightenment one week after ordination as a monk. He led the First Buddhist Council after the Buddha’s death, and his body is supposedly enshrined beneath a mountain in India awaiting the arrival of Maitreya—a future Buddha.
Ashoka the Great
An emperor of the Maurya dynasty, Ashoka the Great ruled most of India from 268 to 232 BCE . Following the massive loss of life in the Kalinga War, he converted to Buddhism and spent the next several years funding its spread across India, constructing memorial pillars, shrines, and stupas
 (Buddhist religious monuments that contain relics).
Nagarjuna
An Indian philosopher and, after the Buddha, one of Buddhism’s most important teachers, Nagarjuna lived in the second century and is known for his writings on sunyata
 , or emptiness. A number of sacred texts are attributed to him, including the Mulamadhyamakakarika
 , or The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way
 . He played a significant role in the development of Mahayana Buddhism.
TO BE BUDDHIST
 “He who walks in the Eightfold Noble Path with unswerving determination is sure to reach nirvana.” —Buddha
Bodhidharma
A Buddhist monk who brought Buddhism to China in the fifth or sixth century CE
 , Bodhidharma is believed to have meditated for nine straight years, staring at a wall, after being refused entry at a Shaolin monastery. After falling asleep seven years into his meditation, according to one legend, he cut off his eyelids so it couldn’t happen again. The lineage of teachers following Bodhidharma led to the development of Zen Buddhism.
Avalokiteshvara
Avalokiteshvara is the bodhisattva (see sidebar here
 ) of compassion, first mentioned in the Lotus Sutra
 . According to some stories, he has multiple faces to see all who need his help and as many as a thousand arms to reach out to those who are suffering. A popular figure of worship, he is also known as Natha
 (Sri Lanka), Lokanat
 (Myanmar), Lokeshvara
 (Thailand), Chenrezig
 (Tibet), and Cundi
 (China). In Tibetan Buddhism, the female bodhisattva Tara came from a single teardrop of Avalokiteshvara’s.
Manjushri
The bodhisattva of wisdom and insight, Manjushri is considered the oldest bodhisattva of Mahayana Buddhism. He is typically shown sitting on a lion skin, holding a fiery sword in his right hand—it cuts through ignorance and ego—and a lotus in his left hand. He first appears in the Lotus Sutra
 and is also associated with poetry and writing.
Kshitigarbha
Kshitigarbha vowed not to enter nirvana until the six realms of hell were emptied. He is known as the protector of children and is usually shown as a monk with a halo, holding a staff (to open the gates of hell) and a jewel (to light the darkness). He is popular in East Asia, where he is known as Jizo
 (Japan), Dayuan Dizang Pusa
 (China), and Sa-E Nyingpo
 (Tibet).
Maitreya
Maitreya is a future Buddha prophesied by the Pali Canon to someday succeed Gautama Buddha, during a time when most of the world will have forgotten the teachings of Buddhism. He is currently thought to reside in the Tushita realm of heaven. Following his earthly appearance, all will live a holy life of unity.
Samantabhadra
As the bodhisattva who protects those who teach Dharma, Samantabhadra is associated with Buddhist meditation and practice. He is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Manjushri in a grouping known as the Shakyamuni trinity
 . He is thought to be unlimited by time or place and, in artwork, often appears riding an elephant with six tusks.
The Dalai Lama
Lama
 is an honorific title given to the spiritual masters of Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai Lama is the leader of the Gelugpa order of lamas and is believed to be a reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara, who once promised the Buddha that he would protect the people of Tibet. Tenzin Gyatso is the current Dalai Lama and the fourteenth in succession. He lives in India, having fled Tibet during the 1959 Tibetan uprising against China.
Padmasambhava
A legendary Indian Buddhist sage, Padmasambhava is revered for introducing Tantric Buddhism to Tibet and writing the Bardo Thodol
 , or Tibetan Book of the Dead
 . He is believed to have been incarnated in a lotus flower as an eight-year-old boy. Some Buddhists consider him the “second Buddha.”
BODHISATTVAS
In the Mahayana tradition, a bodhisattva
 is a Buddhist who is capable of reaching enlightenment but chooses not to on behalf of humanity. Instead of attaining nirvana, the bodhisattva remains within the cycle of death and rebirth to guide others toward their own enlightenment. According to the Lotus Sutra
 , a bodhisattva must display six perfections: generosity, morality or discipline, patience, effort, meditation, and wisdom.
Mahayana Buddhism recognizes many different bodhisattvas, revering them much like Christian saints. This school of Buddhism believes all people can attain enlightenment—whether they’re monks or laypeople—and encourages all Buddhists to pursue the path of a bodhisattva.
The older Theravada tradition does not recognize bodhisattvas and follows only Gautama Buddha.
THE WHEEL OF DHARMA
The dharmachakra
 , also known as the Wheel of Dharma, is most commonly used as the worldwide symbol of Buddhism. It is typically—but not always—depicted with eight spokes, to represent the concept of the Noble Eightfold Path.
MAJOR TENETS
Buddhism tends to minimize dogma
 (a required set of beliefs), emphasizing practice instead. Still, most Buddhists agree to the following teachings.
Creation
When asked about the origins of the universe, the Buddha would often reply that such questions would not lead to nirvana , or liberation. Thus, Buddhism lacks a true creation myth. According to its teachings, the universe has no beginning or end but continues to regenerate itself in cycles.
Deity
Buddhism is nontheistic; it features no belief in a supreme creator or worship of a deity. As a result of this approach, some scholars suggest it shouldn’t be considered a religion at all. While the Buddha is viewed as the founder of the religion, he is not elevated to godlike status. Some Buddhists retain belief in the gods and goddesses of Hinduism, but the Buddha taught that these beings had limited powers. He instructed his followers not to seek divine intervention.
Worship
Buddhist meditation is the practice closest to traditional forms of worship. It may occur at home, where a shrine to the Buddha may be present, or in a temple. Communal practices in a Buddhist temple or monastery are not prescribed, but Buddhists often visit these sites on pilgrimages or simply use them as community centers where they can meditate. Temples contain a statue or image of the Buddha, designed to inspire tranquility.
Scriptures
A huge variety of texts exists in Buddhism, all of which are emphasized differently across different sects and countries. Theravada Buddhists revere the Pali Canon, which includes the Buddha’s teachings as well as those of his disciples. Mahayana Buddhists focus on the Mahayana Sutras as the Buddha’s original teachings. Though the Buddha spent decades teaching, he wrote nothing down. These texts were eventually compiled centuries after his death, based on remembered oral traditions.
The Soul
The Buddha rejected the idea of an eternal soul or permanent self, believing that consciousness and perceptions are illusory and that viewing the self independently from the universe is a delusion. Instead, he taught that there is an ever-changing consciousness within each reincarnation, based on the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.
Karma and Samsara
Buddhists believe life is cyclical, with a potentially endless number of births and rebirths. This cycle, known as samsara
 , is driven by karma, the means by which one’s actions in a current life can relieve or bring about suffering in a subsequent life. This process infuses life with impermanence and causes beings to suffer. Not until one reaches nirvana
 , or liberation, can that suffering end. Some forms of Buddhism believe that certain actions, like reciting mantras, can destroy negative karma.
Nirvana
Nirvana is the liberation from the cycle of samsara. A person achieves it after reaching a state of inner purity or nothingness, characterized by nonattachment to material things and a release of craving or desire.
Dharma
Dharma
 is the teachings of the Buddha, including the Four Noble Truths, one of which is the Noble Eightfold Path.
FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS
The Four Noble Truths are as follows:
1.
 Life involves suffering, and due to samsara, suffering does not end at death.
2.
 Suffering originates in desire and attachment. Our ignorance of reality causes selfishness.
3.
 We can overcome desire and attachment and destroy suffering by attaining nirvana.
4.
 The Eightfold Path is the way to release from suffering.
THE THREE MARKS OF EXISTENCE
The Buddha taught that all of human life was marked by three shared characteristics, the understanding of which was foundational to the Noble Eightfold Path.
Anicca
 (Impermanence): Nothing is permanent. All things are in a constant state of transition from one form to the next. Just as a green leaf eventually falls to the earth and decomposes into soil, the human body continuously ages and approaches death, followed by rebirth.
Dukkha
 (Suffering): Human clinging or desire for permanence results in suffering, anxiety, and frustration. Because of impermanence, all physical or emotional experiences—whether happy or sad—cause dissatisfaction until a person reaches enlightenment.
Anatman
 (Non-self): In contrast to the Hindu concept of atman, or the self, Buddhism teaches “non-self.” All things are constantly coming into being and passing away. This impermanence means that belief in an enduring soul will only cause suffering. Therefore, there is no “I.” Nothing can be described as “mine.” A sentient being is defined not by a soul but by a temporary collection of five elements called skandhas
 : a physical form, feelings, perceptions, impulses, and consciousness. These skandhas often cause humans to interpret life as happening to a distinct self, but that is a false understanding of reality.
THE NOBLE EIGHTFOLD PATH
The Eightfold Path is divided into three categories: prajna
 (the first two parts, representing wisdom), sila (the next three parts, involving morality), and samadhi
 (the final, meditation-related parts). Eight things are required to overcome suffering:
1.
 Right understanding
2.
 Right purpose or intention
3.
 Right speech
4.
 Right action or conduct
5.
 Right livelihood or occupation
6.
 Right effort
7.
 Right contemplation or mindfulness
8.
 Right concentration
These are often depicted as eight spokes on the Wheel of Dharma (see sidebar here
 ).
The Five Precepts
The Five Precepts are the basic code of ethics or moral rules for Buddhists: abstain from taking life (many Buddhists are vegetarian), abstain from taking what has not been given, abstain from sexual misconduct, abstain from false speech, and abstain from alcohol or drugs.
The Five Skandhas
The Five Skandhas are the temporary, moment-by-moment energies or “aggregates” that make up all human individuals. Suffering comes from attachment to these skandhas. In Sanskrit, these are rupa
 (the physical form or body); vedana
 (feelings, or individuals’ physical and mental contact with the external world); samjna
 (the perception resulting from vedana
 , which allows individuals to recognize the world); samskara
 (an individual’s volitions or impulses); and vijnana
 (consciousness or awareness related to the external world).
The Three Jewels
The Three Jewels are the entities to which Buddhists look for guidance: the Buddha, the Dharma
 (the Buddha’s teachings), and the sangha
 (the larger community of practicing Buddhists, especially monastics and those who have attained enlightenment; see sidebar here
 ).
The Middle Way
Before his enlightenment, the Buddha is said to have realized a path of moderation between extreme self-indulgence and extreme self-denial. This practice is considered the deepest wisdom at the heart of Buddhism and is known as the Middle Way
Death
Buddhists accept death as an inevitable aspect of samsara and view it not as the end of life itself, but as the end of one particular body. Monastic Buddhists and laypeople alike are taught to approach death with a calm and controlled mind. Dying Buddhists, or their family members, often request the presence of a monk or nun to assist in a peaceful death. The chanting of mantras around the deathbed is considered an essential aid in the journey toward rebirth.
The deceased is treated with respect after death, and funeral preparations are often withheld for several hours in case the transition into the next state is not yet complete. Most Buddhists desire to be cremated after death—a testament to the impermanence of life—and memorial services are often conducted by monks.
SKY BURIALS
For centuries, some Buddhist traditions, especially in places like Tibet or Nepal— geographical locations largely devoid of timber, or too rocky to dig a grave—have practiced sky burial
 rather than cremation. In this funeral practice, the deceased is placed on a mountaintop, exposed to the elements, and allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals and birds as a final act of generosity. Declining vulture populations and governmental prohibitions have diminished the tradition in recent years, though it does continue in some rural areas. In Tibet, sky burial is known asjhator
 , or “giving alms to the birds,” and is mentioned in the Tibetan Book of the Dead
SANGHA
The monastic tradition is central to Buddhism. Dating back to the life of Gautama Buddha and his followers in the fifth century BCE, it is one of the earliest monastic traditions in any religion that still survives today. Buddhist monks and nuns commit to practicing the Buddha’s teachings full time, and also are responsible for guiding lay practitioners of the faith and preserving Dharma
 , or the Buddha’s teachings.
The Buddhist monastic community is known as the sangha
 . These monks and nuns live by an elaborate framework of disciplines called vinaya
 , a set of moral rules passed down from the Buddha to his disciples. These vows include only eating before noon (the rest of the day is spent studying and meditating), observing complete chastity, wearing robes, and shaving one’s head. Monks beg for their food and limit their possessions to robes and a belt, a begging bowl, a razor, and minor personal items. Monastic Buddhists are prohibited from actions like viewing TV or other entertainment, wearing perfumes or bodily adornments, accepting money, and sleeping in luxurious beds. A monk may not share sleeping quarters with a woman and must be accompanied by another man any time he is in the presence of a woman.
According to tradition, the Buddha was reluctant to permit women to join his sangha community until female members of his family wished to become his followers. He relented, but Buddhist nuns follow a set of rules called the Eight Garudhammas
 that makes them subordinate to monks—for instance, they must rise to greet monks and are forbidden to correct monks. Despite this, traditional Buddhist teaching maintains that women can achieve enlightenment.
Afterlife/Cosmology
In Buddhism, as in Hinduism, a human repeatedly transitions into a new form after death until reaching nirvana. This is not understood as a soul moving to a new body—Buddhists do not believe in a permanent self—but rather as one consciousness evolving into another during the process of rebirth. Some Mahayana traditions believe there is an intermediate state between lives that lasts anywhere from three days to seven years, but Theravada Buddhists reject this teaching. Rebirth may take one of six forms of existence:
1.Naraka
 beings, who endure torment in a temporary hell
2.Preta
 beings, or invisible “hungry ghosts” who struggle to satisfy their appetites
3.
 Animals
4.
 Humans
5.Asuras
 , or low-ranking warring demigods
6.Devas
 , or powerful and invisible supernatural beings who benefit from good karma
MAJOR TEXTS
Unlike the authoritative scriptures of many other religions, Buddhism does not have a primary religious text. Instead, it has a nearly boundless collection of sacred writings. These are typically divided into two categories: canonical texts
 , which are believed to be the words of the Buddha, and noncanonical texts
 , which are commentaries, histories, and other writings. Some writings contain elements of both. And some traditions—like Zen Buddhism—deny the necessity of scriptures altogether. A few of the most prominent Buddhist scriptures include the following.
Pali Canon
Also known as the Tripitaka, the Pali Canon is a compilation of the Buddha’s teachings compiled in the first century CE
 , several centuries after his life. These were based on oral tradition and written in Pali, an Indian language similar to what the Buddha would have spoken. Tripitaka
 means “three baskets” and includes three sections. The Vinaya Pitaka
 contains monastic instructions. The Sutta Pitaka
 consists of more than 10,000 of the Buddha’s discourses or sayings, along with some from his disciples. The Abhidhamma Pitaka
 includes commentary on the Buddha’s teachings. These are the primary scriptures of Theravada Buddhism.
DHAMMAPADA
A collection of 423 verses spoken by the Buddha in the Sutta Pitaka
 “basket” of the Pali Canon, the Dhammapada
 is widely considered the most concise representation of his teachings. These sayings are arranged into twenty-six chapters covering various topics, including punishment, happiness, and pleasure. It is accompanied by the Dhammapada Atthakatha
 , a commentary with 305 stories related to the verses.
Mahayana Sutras
While Mahayana Buddhists respect the Pali Canon, they also rely on the teachings of the Mahayana Sutras. (Sutras
 are collections of the Buddha’s sayings.) Written between 200 BCE
 and 200 CE
 , there are hundreds of these texts, including the influential Heart Sutra
 , the Lotus Sutra
 , and the Pure Land Sutras
 . Most Mahayana traditions accept these as original, authentic teachings of the Buddha.
HEART SUTRA
A short, beloved sutra composed of 260 Chinese characters or sixteen English sentences, the Heart Sutra
 outlines the Five Skandhas, the Four Noble Truths, and the centrality of sunyata
 , or emptiness. The entire Heart Sutra
 is often memorized and chanted during meditation.
LOTUS SUTRA
One of the most influential and highly regarded of the Mahayana Sutras, the Lotus Sutra is considered by many to be the ultimate teaching of the Buddha. The Lotus Sutra
 is arranged as a twenty-eight-chapter discourse given by Buddha as he neared death. It introduces bodhisattvas as embodiments of the Buddha and emphasizes that all beings—including women and animals—are spiritually equal and can attain nirvana in the current life.
PURE LAND SUTRAS
The Pure Land Sutras
 are a collection of sutras describing a savior bodhisattva named Amitabha who rules a western paradise. Those who call on his name can reside in a “pure land” of beauty and bliss, meditating without the distraction of samsara until they reach enlightenment. These texts are the basis of the Pure Land Buddhism sects of China and Japan.
Tibetan Book of the Dead
Known in Tibetan as the Bardo Thodol
 , the Tibetan Book of the Dead
 is an ancient text written to guide the deceased through the 49-day transition between death and the next rebirth. Traditionally thought to have been written by the sage Padmasambhava in the eighth century CE
 , it offers instructions for the dying as well as for those who will carry out their funeral rites.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
Buddhist rituals differ from one school to the next, but they’re generally related to honoring the Buddha and his teachings.
Leaders
Buddhism lacks a priesthood, but maintains a robust monastic tradition in the sangha (see sidebar here
 ). These men and women are its spiritual leaders.
Religious Gatherings or Services
Apart from festivals (see sidebar here
 ), Buddhism has few requirements for public religious gatherings or services. Public talks or meditation services often take place at viharas
 , or temples, led by members of the monastic community. These are more common in Western cultures where people are accustomed to regular worship services.
Prostration
While Buddhists do not worship the Buddha as a god, they do show reverence to his teachings with prostration, or taking a bowing position before his image. Prostration is a devotional act that acknowledges the Buddha’s attainment of perfect enlightenment. It is thought to help prepare a person for meditation, remove unwholesome mental states like conceit or desire, and accumulate good karma. Prostration typically takes place before meditation.
PILGRIMAGES
Though they’re not required to do so, Buddhists often go on pilgrimages to shrines or other places associated with the Buddha’s life. In India, these holy centers include four main sites:
Bodh Gaya:
 The traditional place of the Buddha’s enlightenment, in India, under the ancient Bodhi tree. Pilgrims visit the Mahabodhi Vihar, a temple located directly east of a tree thought to descend from the original.
Kusinara:
 The site of the Buddha’s death in a small town in northeast India. The Parinirvana Stupa contains an enormous statue of a reclining “dying Buddha,” and the neighboring Ramabhar Stupa marks the place where the Buddha was cremated.
Lumbini:
 The traditional birthplace of the Buddha, in modern-day Nepal. Pilgrims visit the oldest pillar in Nepal, erected by Emperor Ashoka during his own pilgrimage in the third century BCE. Nearby, the Maya Devi Temple contains a bathing pool, which is thought to have been used by the Buddha’s mother before she gave birth.
Sarnath:
 A city in India where the Buddha delivered his first sermon after his enlightenment. The location is marked by the Dhamek Stupa, built in the sixth century CE. Nearby, a pillar commemorates Emperor Ashoka’s pilgrimage to this site.
Prayer
Most Buddhists do not pray in the traditional sense of hoping to gain favor or present requests to a divine figure. But they do perform rituals to focus their thoughts during meditation. Many Buddhists begin by reciting the Three Jewels—the Buddha, the Dharma
 (his teachings), and the sangha
 (the Buddhist community)—a practice known as “taking refuge.” Tibetan Buddhists repeat mantras while turning cylinder-shaped prayer wheels or allowing prayer flags to flap in the wind. These flags are decorated with mantras and images. Each flap is thought to spread compassion into the flag’s surroundings. Pure Land Buddhists do have a custom that resembles more conventional prayer. They repeat the name of the bodhisattva Amitabha, believing he will take them to the Pure Land.
Mantras
Repeated mantras, or phrases, are used to still the mind for meditation. These may be very simple, like saying the name of the Buddha. Others are longer, including the six-syllable phrase om mani padme hum
 , a popular mantra related to the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara that is thought to purge six different impurities.
BUDDHAHOOD
 “If there is one practice that is sufficient to bring about buddhahood, it is the practice of great compassion.” —Dalai Lama
Meditation
Meditation helps Buddhists clear their minds, minimize suffering, and understand the true nature of the universe. One primary form of meditation is anapanasati
 , or “mindfulness of breathing.” This discipline connects a person to the present moment by focusing on and even counting each breath.
Another prominent meditational practice is metta bhavana
 , or “loving kindness.” Its purpose is to cultivate a feeling of love or benevolence for the world. Practitioners begin by stimulating metta for themselves, then for friends, strangers, enemies, and the larger world.
In Tibetan Buddhism, metta combines with breathing: Each exhalation sends good will into the world, and each inhalation absorbs suffering. Tibetan Buddhists also meditate by walking around a sacred site, a practice known as circumambulation
 . Often, a Buddhist will circle an image of the Buddha, a stupa, or a vihara three times to represent the Three Jewels.
Shrines
Most Buddhist temples and many homes have shrines to the Buddha, ranging from elaborate statues to simpler illustrations or prints. These are the focal points of many Buddhist rituals and help practitioners remember the Buddha’s qualities. Other elements are also present at these shrines, including scriptures (which represent the Dharma) and photos of Buddhist monks (which represent the sangha).
Vihara
Viharas
 are Buddhist monasteries, originally constructed as shelters for wandering monks during the rainy season. Today they act as both community centers for learning and spiritual centers where Buddhists gather to meditate and learn from monks.
Offerings and Alms
At shrines or viharas, Buddhists make symbolic offerings to the Buddha, including candles, incense, water, fruit, or flowers. These gifts are not required by the Buddha but serve as reminders to adherents. For instance, flowers remind them to live in the present. Water reminds them of how the Buddha’s teachings can cleanse the mind. The spreading fragrance of incense reminds them of the spread of moral conduct.
Because Buddhist monks and nuns live in deliberate poverty, they are supported by daily almsgiving of clothing or food by laypeople. This act is thought to bring merit or good karma, as well as develop desirable spiritual qualities like humility.
Stupa
A stupa
 is a Buddhist burial mound housing the remains of a bodhisattva or member of the sangha. Other stupas are built to house scriptures or relics thought to have belonged to the Buddha, or to commemorate events associated with the Buddha. Stupas are usually stone and often become places of pilgrimage. In the Far East, stupas evolved into elaborate tiered pagodas.
Birth Rituals
Some Buddhists request a blessing from a monk and may take a newborn to a Buddhist temple for a formal naming ceremony. Otherwise, Buddhism lacks specific birth traditions apart from those related to a Buddhist’s individual community, culture, or family.
Marriage Rituals
Buddhism views marriage as an entirely secular concern with no religious connection. Most Buddhists marry according to the rituals of their culture or family, but may request a blessing from a monk after the ceremony.
Sin
Buddhism has no concept of sin related to an individual’s relationship with a deity. Rather, it conceives of wrongdoing as behaviors that bring negative karmic consequences and therefore suffering in a later life.
Repentance/Purification
Negative karma can be destroyed and suffering overcome through the pursuit of the Noble Eightfold Path.
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
The most popular festivals in Buddhism are all associated with the life of the Buddha.
VESAK DAY (MAY OR JUNE)
Also known as Buddha Day
 , this annual festival takes place on the full moon of the ancient Hindu month of Vaisakha, commemorating the birth, enlightenment, and death of the Buddha— which some believe to have happened on the same day of the calendar year. Some Buddhist schools celebrate only the birth, or only the enlightenment, but it remains the most important festival of the calendar, particularly for the Theravada tradition. Buddhists make offerings, visit shrines, decorate their houses, and light candles to symbolize the Buddha’s enlightenment.
BODHI DAY (DECEMBER 8)
An important day in Mahayana traditions like Zen Buddhism, this day commemorates the Buddha’s enlightenment, achieved while sitting under the Bodhi tree. Buddhists often observe this day by lighting candles and engaging in readings, chanting of texts, and meditation. In some Western cultures, Bodhi Day has become integrated with the Christian holiday of Christmas. Buddhist families may decorate a ficus tree with colored lights or string lights around their homes to symbolize enlightenment.
DHARMA DAY (JULY)
A Theravada Buddhist festival, Dharma Day
 celebrates Buddha’s first sermon after his enlightenment, during which he taught the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. It is also known as Asalha Puja
 , and Buddhists worldwide visit monasteries, listen to Dharma talks, and reflect on the Buddha’s teachings. Like most Buddhist festivals, Dharma Day is a quiet observance rather than a parade or party.
UPOSATHA OBSERVANCE DAYS
These are special days related to the phases of the moon, set aside for more intense personal practice of the Buddha’s teachings. They occur multiple times a month—depending on the country and Buddhist tradition—and are usually observed on the day of the full moon and the new moon. Lay Buddhists who live near a monastery are expected to visit it while wearing white robes. There they meditate, make offerings, and listen to teachings from the monks. It is believed that the Buddha himself instituted these observance days.
DIVISIONS
Buddhism itself arose from Hinduism, adapting the teachings of the diverse Indian religion. It jettisoned the deities and complex beliefs of that faith, promoting practices—rather than beliefs—in the pursuit of nirvana. The Buddha taught that any path toward enlightenment was worth traveling, and as his teachings spread throughout India and into Asia, those practices merged with local traditions. As a result, there are many different ways to practice Buddhism, many of which are divided by geography. The two primary schools of Buddhist thought are Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism.
Theravada Buddhism
This is the oldest school of Buddhist thought, primarily practiced in southern countries like Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar/ Burma. Monastics are central to the religion and are considered the ideal expression of Buddhism—and the only path toward nirvana. Theravada Buddhists’ primary scripture is the Pali Canon. They reject the idea of bodhisattvas.
Mahayana Buddhism
A school of thought developing in the second century BCE
 , Mahayana Buddhism teaches that enlightenment is available in this lifetime to everyone—not just monks. Mahayana Buddhists revere bodhisattvas who help inspire others toward enlightenment. They anticipate the coming of Maitreya, a future successor to Gautama Buddha. Mahayana Buddhism is the largest branch of Buddhism and predominates in China, Japan, Tibet, Korea, and Vietnam. Other prominent sects have developed within Mahayana Buddhism, including Pure Land, Nichiren, Vajrayana, Tibetan, and Zen.
Vajrayana Buddhism
Also known as Tantric Buddhism, this sect is based on ritual texts called Tantras
 , teachings of the Buddha that instruct individuals on the use of meditation, mandalas, ritual, and other techniques to achieve enlightenment. One of those techniques involves channeling pleasure or desire into enlightenment. As a result, Tantric Buddhism has a deep association with sexual desire in Western culture. It is prevalent in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, and Mongolia.
Pure Land Buddhism
A sect in China and Japan is devoted to Amitabha, a savior bodhisattva who rules a “pure land” paradise where his followers hope to be reborn apart from the samsara cycle, making the journey toward enlightenment easier. Pure Land Buddhism began in ancient India, spread into China and Japan, then grew rapidly in Japan in the twelfth century. Pure Land Buddhists meditate by repeating proclamations of their faith in Amitabha.
Nichiren Buddhism
Nichiren Buddhism is a self-focused religion promoting individual transformation, founded by the Japanese monk Nichiren and based on the teachings of the Lotus Sutra
 as the exclusive path to enlightenment. (It is occasionally known as the “Lotus sect.”) Nichiren rejected all other Buddhist traditions. Adherents chant a phrase known as daimoku
 : nam-myoho-renge-kyo
 , or “I take refuge in the Lotus Sutra
 .” The modern Japanese Buddhist reform sect Soka Gakkai emerged from Nichiren Buddhism.
Tibetan Buddhism
A form of Mahayana Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism developed in relative isolation after arriving in seventh-century Tibet. It emphasizes Tantras and mandalas
 (mystical diagrams), as aids to meditation. A special class of monks called lamas
 is honored in Tibetan Buddhism as teachers of enlightenment, and the leader of one order, known as the Dalai Lama, is believed to come from a lineage of reincarnations of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. The succession of Dalai Lamas has led Tibet for the past three centuries.
WHAT ABOUT ZEN?
Zen
 is a practice that emphasizes simplicity and meditation. Founded in China by Bodhidharma, an Indian monk who taught an awakened consciousness independent of rituals or scriptures, it began to flourish in Japan in the twelfth century.
According to Zen Buddhism, insight arrives naturally when the mind is free from other thoughts, words, prayers, and desire. That personal experience of emptiness matters more than anything else, and there are no other formal teachings. Actions are central to Zen. There are two schools of Zen Buddhism: Rinzai
 and Soto
■Rinzai Zen uses provocative questions, dialogues, or koans
 (riddles), to bring about sudden enlightenment. Zen masters occasionally even use physical violence, like striking a student, to prevent too much thinking.
■Soto Zen practitioners focus less on koans and more on the performance of zazen
 — sitting in an upright position with legs and hands folded and suspending the mind from logical thinking with no expectation of enlightenment.
Zen Buddhism is one of the most popular expressions of Buddhism in the West. It became popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s due to the influence of Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg and authors like Robert M. Pirsig, who wrote Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
 . Zen gardens are often recognizable by Westerners, with their carefully arranged stones; these abstract Japanese rock gardens were designed to promote meditation through minimalism.
ENLIGHTENMENT OR IGNORANCE?
The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche once praised Buddhism’s de-emphasis on deity, proclaiming it more honest, more benevolent, and “a hundred times more realistic” than Christianity. The emphasis on compassion and happiness—and the practical methods for achieving these states—have made Buddhism one of the world’s most peaceful and stable religions. Despite all the suffering in the world, Buddhism offers hope that misery and pain can someday be overcome through enlightenment.
In opposition, while relief from suffering may be one of Buddhism’s best features, it has also led to outside criticism and serious questions about the religion. Does Buddhism dehumanize suffering? By teaching that suffering results from karma, does it cause people to accept their current position rather than strive to overcome it? Does karma justify social, economic, or gender inequality? Moreover, is Buddhism fatalistic or even nihilistic? Is its emphasis on detachment from the world good for society? After all, one of Siddhartha Gautama’s first actions was to abandon his family in pursuit of enlightenment.
Furthermore, Buddhism’s inherent focus on inner peace rather than outer peace, along with subservience to political systems, has also been a problem over the years. In Theravada Buddhist countries like Myanmar/Burma, the hazy lines between the monastic sangha’s spiritual leadership and political leadership have resulted in Buddhist nationalist movements, some of which have erupted in violence against Muslims. The religion’s focus on individual enlightenment has also caused a number of non-Buddhist activists to question its relevance in terms of social justice and action on behalf of the oppressed.
INTO THE FUTURE
As science reveals more and more about the human condition—from the history of the earth to human evolution to our understanding of the brain and personality—many have looked to Buddhism as the ideal religion. Lacking a supernatural being and flexible in its doctrines, it seems well poised to adapt to an increasingly scientific worldview. Its contemplative practices and emphasis on peace and mindfulness are popular concepts in the West, where Buddhism has gradually begun to enter the mainstream.
In the East, Buddhism is a powerful religion in countries like China, Tibet, South Korea, Thailand, and Burma—all of which are threatened by unstable political systems and the potential for military threats and persecution. The ruling Communist Party of China has become more tolerant in recent decades—it now views Buddhism as an essential part of the culture—but for a long time, it engendered conflict with Buddhism and other popular religions throughout the region. Threats from Western culture, including the expansion of Islam and Christianity and the shift toward a more secular and materialistic culture, may also impact the values of traditional Buddhism.SIKHISM
The Sikh religion may be one of the most misunderstood in the world. In the months following the terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, hundreds of hate crimes were inflicted on American Sikhs because they were mistaken for Muslims. Four days after the tragedy, a Sikh business owner was shot and killed in Mesa, Arizona, by a man who claimed it was an act of patriotism.
What he didn’t know is that the turban-wearing Sikhs represent the American ideal perhaps as well as any religion on earth. Democracy, equality, hospitality, and religious inclusiveness are all essential to the Sikh tradition—a tradition that has almost nothing to do with Islam. The faith began when a mystical experience caused Guru Nanak, the religion’s fifteenth-century founder, to create an alternative religious path apart from Islam and Hinduism. In fact, Sikhs have a long history of persecution and martyrdom at the hands of the Islamic Mughal Empire that once controlled the Sikh homeland of Punjab, now split between modern India and Pakistan.
Sikhism is the world’s fifth-largest religion. While the vast majority of its adherents live in India, Western nations like Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States have extensive populations of devout Sikhs. A Sikh is monotheistic—believing in one eternal God—and follows the teachings of a succession of ten human gurus as well the Guru Granth Sahib, a collection of hymns written by those gurus. This simple faith seeks to serve others, achieve unity with the Creator, and recognize the divinity within every human.
BETWEEN FAITHS
In 1469, a young boy named Nanak was born to a Hindu family of merchants in Punjab, the northern section of India now divided between India and Pakistan. Nanak grew up in the Hindu faith but was also exposed to Islam by a longtime companion, a musician named Bhai Mardana. During this time, the Islamic Mughal Empire ruled the Punjab, and conflict between the minority Muslims and majority Hindus was common.
Contemplative and deeply spiritual, Nanak grew up immersed in religious teachings. At the age of thirty, he approached a local stream to perform a ritual bathing and had a vision from God. Nanak disappeared for three days, leaving his clothes near the shore. His family and friends thought he had drowned until he returned to announce that he had been taken into God’s presence. “There is neither Hindu nor Muslim,” he told them, “but only man. So whose path shall I follow? I shall follow God’s path.”

 Guru Granth Sahib
Along with Mardana, Nanak began traveling through, India preaching his message of reconciliation between the Hindu religion and Islam. He taught that, as in Islam, there was only one omnipresent, transcendent God rather than the many gods of Hinduism. Yet he also retained Hinduism’s doctrines of karma and rebirth. Though he was opposed by both faiths, Nanak lived a life of pacifism, teaching that salvation and unity with God were closely tied to an individual’s right behavior and service toward others. His followers began calling him Guru Nanak, and they became known as Sikhs
 , which means “disciples” in Sanskrit. Nanak became the first of ten gurus, the spiritual leaders of the Sikh movement.
As the upstart religion grew, so did hostility toward it from Hindus and Muslims. Many Sikhs were imprisoned. Several gurus were executed for their beliefs. The once-nonviolent Sikhs became more militant, and, in 1708, Guru Gobind Singh declared an end to the succession of human gurus. Rather than name a successor, he proclaimed that the Sikh holy book, the Adi Granth
 , would become the last teacher Sikhs would ever need. Soon after, Guru Gobind Singh was executed by two assassins sent by Wazir Khan, a Mughal governor.
SAINTS AND SOLDIERS
Hindus persecuted Sikhs as heretics, and the Mughal Empire forced Indians to convert to Islam or face death. Seeing these injustices—along with the frequent assassinations of Sikh gurus—Guru Har Gobind militarized his followers in the seventeenth century, calling for Sikhs to defend themselves from persecution.
In 1699, after several more assassinations, Guru Gobind Singh established an order of Sikhs called the Khalsa
 . Though the Sikhs he recruited were farmers and carpenters, he began calling them by the Punjabi word for lion: Singh
 . Likewise, women adopted the surname Kaur
 , which means “lioness.” Last names identified a person’s caste in India, and taking these new names was a nod to the equality of all individuals, regardless of caste. The Khalsa had a strict code of conduct and, among other things, vowed to protect the weak and never bow to tyranny. They were to be both saints and soldiers at the same time, living lives of selfless devotion but ready to defend their faith when necessary.
Like Hindus and Jains, Sikhs promote ahimsa
 , or nonviolence. But Sikhs believe that one aspect of nonviolence is the prevention of violence. Therefore, one cannot ignore violence being performed against a defenseless person and must step in as a last resort.
During the British occupation of India between 1858 and 1947, colonial forces recognized the skill and dedication of the Khalsa, employing Sikhs as policemen, soldiers, and bodyguards. They are likely to be found in those careers as well as in transportation careers today. Most Sikhs retain Singh as a last name and can be visually identified by the Five Ks (see sidebar here
 ).
MAJOR FIGURES
The most important figures within the Sikh religion are undoubtedly its human gurus, beginning with Guru Nanak in the fifteenth century. While all were influential, a few stand out in particular. The following list includes them, then extends to more contemporary spiritual leaders.
Guru Nanak
The founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak was born in 1469 in Punjab. He worked as an accountant within the merchant caste until he had a mystical encounter with God at the age of thirty. After declaring he was neither a Hindu nor a Muslim, he gave away his possessions and began traveling throughout India teaching the truth about God. Along the way, Nanak gained followers who called him guru
 and called themselves Sikhs
 , or disciples. Guru Nanak established public meeting places for Sikhs called gurdwaras
 . Before his death in 1539, he identified one of his followers as the next guru.
Guru Ram Das
The fourth Sikh guru, Guru Ram Das was the founder of the holy Sikh city of Amritsar in 1574. Many of his hymns are included in the Guru Granth Sahib. He also wrote the Lavan, a four-part hymn central to the Sikh marriage ceremony. He died of natural causes after seven years in leadership.
Guru Arjan
Guru Arjan was the fifth Sikh guru and compiler of the Adi Granth, the holy scriptures of the faith. The Granth included hymns and teachings written by previous gurus as well as his own writings. During his time in leadership, Arjan also designed and built the Harmandir Sahib (“Golden Temple”) at Amritsar, the holiest gurdwara for Sikhs. He was executed in 1606 after refusing to convert to Islam under the orders of the Mughal Empire, making him the first Sikh martyr.
PRAISE FOR SIKHISM
 British philosopher Bertrand Russell, a prominent antiwar activist and agnostic, rarely had kind words for the world’s religious systems. But upon accepting the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950, he said this: “If some lucky men survive the onslaught of the third world war of atomic and hydrogen bombs, the Sikh religion will be the only means of guiding them. It has the capability, but Sikhs have not brought out in broad daylight the splendid doctrines of this religion which has come into existence for the benefit of entire mankind. This is their greatest sin and the Sikhs cannot be freed of it.”
Guru Har Gobind
The sixth Sikh guru, Guru Har Gobind was responsible for first training and arming Sikhs to resist persecution and protect the defenseless. He was the son of Guru Arjan, who, prior to his execution, named him as his successor though he was only eleven years old. While training his followers, Guru Har Gobind wore two symbolic kirpans
 (daggers): one to represent miri
 , temporal power achieved by might, and one to represent piri
 , spiritual authority achieved through faith and devotion.
Guru Tegh Bahadur
Known for standing with Punjabi Hindus against the Mughal Empire’s forced conversions, Tegh Bahadur was the ninth Sikh guru. He wrote dozens of hymns in the Guru Granth Sahib before being tortured and publicly beheaded by the Mughals for refusing to convert to Islam.
Guru Gobind Singh
The final Sikh guru in human form, Guru Gobind Singh is recognized for founding the Khalsa order of militarized Sikhs and for refusing to name a human successor. Instead, he proclaimed that the sacred hymns of the faith, the Adi Granth, would be the final, eternal guru. He died from injuries incurred during an assassination attempt by representatives of the Mughal Empire.
Baba Banda Singh Bahadur
A disciple of Guru Gobind Singh, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur became a Sikh at a young age, and commanded the fighting Khalsa against the Mughals. He also established the fortress of Lohgarh and, from it, led the first Sikh state from 1710 to 1715. He was executed by the Mughals in 1716 for refusing to convert to Islam.
Maharaja Ranjit Singh
Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the founder of the secular Sikh Empire in the Punjab. The state lasted from 1799 to 1849, and Ranjit Singh took power in 1801 as a twenty-year-old. He is known for upgrading the army with modern artillery and weaponry. The Sikh Golden Temple, or Harmandir Sahib
 , was fully renovated with gold and marble during his reign.
Bhai Kanhaiya
A disciple of Guru Tegh Bahadur, Bhai Kanhaiya founded the Sikh Sevapanthi spiritual order, a celibate community dedicated to public service. He was known for his compassion on the battlefield, providing water to fellow Sikhs as well as their enemies. When Guru Gobind Singh asked him about this practice, he replied that in everyone he saw no Mughals or Sikhs, but only the face of the guru. He died in 1718 of natural causes.
Bhagat Puran Singh
A former Hindu who became a Sikh as a child during the early twentieth century, Bhagat Puran Singh was a prominent writer and philanthropist. In 1924, when he was only nineteen years old, he founded Pingalwara, a home for the destitute in Amritsar which is still in operation today and has multiple branches in the Indian state of Punjab.
Bhai Trilochan Singh Panesar
A Sikh engineer, Bhai Trilochan Singh Panesar was inspired by the teachings of the gurus and Mother Teresa, and embarked on a mission to feed the poor before retirement. During his lifetime, he helped resettle orphans, construct hospitals and temples, and feed thousands, and he was known for having worked to clean all Delhi’s gurdwaras. He died in 2010.
Yogi Bhajan
Yogi Bhajan was the director and founder of the Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization (3HO) in the United States. Born into a Sikh family in India, he studied yoga before immigrating to Canada in 1968. From there, he got involved with the US counterculture and taught meditation-focused Kundalini yoga. His nonprofit 3HO promoted a comprehensive lifestyle extending beyond yoga into diet and attire. Bhajan died in 2004, but 3HO continues to operate.
THE KHANDA
The symbol of Sikhism is the Khanda, an artistic representation of three swords and a circular throwing weapon known as a chakkar
 . The middle, vertical sword is double-edged and represents the power of God. Its two edges symbolize divine justice (the punishment of evil) and freedom (which should be guided by virtue).
The two outer weapons, which cross each other at the bottom, are kirpans
 , the ceremonial daggers carried by all Sikhs. They represent the concept of Miri Piri
 , two balanced forms of authority—temporal/political (miri
 ) and spiritual (piri
 )—as taught by Guru Har Gobind, the sixth guru who first armed the Sikhs to protect against persecution.
The circular chakkar behind and between the swords signifies eternity, the timelessness of divinity, and the necessary balance between miri and piri. This combination of weapons is viewed by Sikhs as a visual depiction of their duty to serve one another (seva
 ) and protect the defenseless.
MAJOR TENETS
Sikh doctrine is simple, encouraging a life balanced between inner spirituality and outward service toward one’s fellow man.
Creation
Waheguru, the supreme God, existed alone before creating the universe billions of years ago. He spoke it into being, establishing the universe and all the galaxies within, including the sun, moon, and planets. On earth, Wahe-guru established three worlds of life—water, land, and air—that teemed with creatures. All creation came from Waheguru and will someday be reabsorbed into his spirit.
Deity
God, or Naam
 —Sanskrit for “name”—is a genderless, formless, omnipresent, all-pervading spirit. Humans communicate with God through meditation and enlightenment. Naam is also known among Sikhs as Waheguru (“wonderful guru”) or Akal Purakh (“timeless one”). A common prayer is straightforward repetition of “Waheguru.”
Gurus
Sikhism has had a succession of ten human leaders, beginning with Guru Nanak in the 1400s and ending with Guru Gobind Singh, who was assassinated in 1708. Prior to his death, Guru Gobind Singh established that the Sikh sacred writings would become the final, eternal guru: Guru Granth Sahib.
Scriptures
The Guru Granth Sahib is the primary religious text of the Sikhs. It is a sequence of hymns written and compiled over the years by the gurus. Sikhs rely on it as a spiritual guide with divine origins, and believe it contains every answer to questions about religious practice or morality.
Karma
Like other Indian religions, Sikhism teaches that life is cyclical, and a person’s actions in one life can positively or negatively impact their next life. However, rather than seek liberation through asceticism, Sikhs hope to escape the cycle of life and death through daily morality.
Hukam
Sikhs believe the entire universe is subject to God’s hukam
 , or divine will
 . Sikhs must attempt to live in harmony with hukam to achieve liberation and avoid haumai
 , or the overvaluing of worldly success.
Haumai and Nimrata
Haumai refers to the poisonous thoughts of self-centeredness or pride that keep a person from fully submitting to God and living in harmony with hukam. Nimrata
 refers to humility, a virtue considered the opposite of haumai. Sikhs believe meditation on God and seva
 , or selfless service, is the best way to restrict haumai and cultivate nimrata.
Seva
Seva
 is one of the foundational principals of Sikhism, in which serving humanity is considered a primary element of devotion. Seva is any work performed without the expectation of personal benefit or reward. Many Sikhs perform seva by washing dishes or serving food at gurdwaras, or by volunteering at hospitals.
Mukti
Similar to the concept of moksha
 in Hinduism, mukti
 is liberation or enlightenment from the cycle of life and death. It is attained once a person has “died” to his or her self-centeredness. It cannot be attained based on actions alone; it must be the gift of God. Sikhs don’t pursue mukti to reach an eternal paradise but rather to reunite with God.
The Three Pillars
Guru Nanak taught three basic guidelines for Sikhs. The first is Naam Japna
 , or focus on God, through the practice of simran
 , the meditational repetition of God’s name. The second is Kirat Karni
 , or honest living. This means speaking the truth, living with decency, and working hard, while also accepting the gifts and blessings of God. The third is the practice of Vand Chhako
 , or sharing with others and pursuing the common good by giving to the community.
The Five Thieves
Sikhs believe the major weaknesses of the human personality must be subdued or erased to live in full devotion to God. These are kaam
 (lust or addiction), krodh
 (rage), lobh
 (greed or materialism), moh
 (worldly attachment), and ahankar
 (ego or conceitedness). These are sometimes also called the Five Evils or Five Vices.
The Five Virtues
To reach mukti
 , or salvation, Sikhs must develop certain qualities that guide them closer to the divine. These are sat
 (speaking the truth and acting justly), santokh
 (contentment or acceptance of life’s circumstances), daya
 (compassion or mercy), nimrata
 (humility), and pyare
 (love of God and others). The devout Sikh must always be pursuing and practicing these qualities.
Death and the Afterlife
When a Sikh dies, the body is washed, placed in clean clothing, and adorned with the “Five Ks.” Relatives and friends carry the deceased to a funeral pyre for cremation while reciting prayers and singing hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib. A close relative—usually the eldest son if available—lights the fire or otherwise begins the cremation process. Gravestones or memorials to the dead are discouraged, as are public displays of grief. The ashes are disposed of in the nearest river, and the family begins a full reading of the Guru Granth Sahib.
According to the Guru Granth Sahib, the human body is merely the soul’s “clothing” and will be cast aside at death. Sikhs believe in reincarnation and reject the idea of realms like heaven or hell. They believe a soul’s final destination is union with God—who judges a soul at the end of each lifetime and determines whether the soul will reincarnate or remain with him, thereby breaking the cycle of death and rebirth.
THE FIVE Ks
Guru Gobind Singh, who founded the Khalsa order during a period of intense persecution, called for Sikh men to be willing to die to defend their faith and protect the weak. When most Sikh boys and girls reach adulthood, they commit to Khalsa values and are baptized into the Sikh community in a ceremony called the Amrit Sanchar
 . Afterward, a Sikh wears five articles of faith known as the Five Ks
 , which have become essential elements of the Sikh identity. Only Sikhs who have submitted to the Amrit Sanchar can wear all five Ks. Sikhs who have not participated in the Amrit Sanchar are known as Sahajdharis
 , and may be seen wearing one or more of these articles.
While a turban (dastaar
 ) is not one of the Five Ks, it is perhaps the most visible aspect of a Sikh’s outward appearance. Turbans were once worn exclusively by royalty, but gurus began wearing them to show that all people were equal. A turban has become mandatory for adult male Sikhs and helps protect their long hair. Smaller turbans are optional for women.
Kachera:
 Drawstring undergarments similar to boxer shorts, kachera
 are worn by men and women beneath their clothing. Their purpose is to remind Sikhs to control their sexual urges and view the opposite sex not as objects of desire but as fellow humans.
Kesh:
 Uncut hair is referred to as kesh
 . Since Sikhs consider hair to be a gift from God, they do not cut their hair, beards, or any other body hair. This practice symbolizes acceptance of God’s will and the avoidance of vanity.
Kanga:
 This special wood or ivory comb holds the hair in place beneath a turban. Unlike some Indian holy men who let their hair become untidy or matted, Sikhs are expected to keep their hair well groomed, using the kanga to comb it twice a day.
Kara:
 A steel bracelet worn on the right wrist, the kara
 serves as a visible reminder of the Sikh’s duty to avoid the Five Thieves. Its circular shape represents unity with God and others.
Kirpan:
 A ceremonial dagger or small sword, the kirpan
 reminds Sikhs of their duty to defend the helpless and, if necessary, fight for the faith. Often, instead of a full dagger, Sikhs wear a small 3.5-inch-long kirpan beneath their clothing.
MAJOR TEXTS
The Sikh scriptures are considered the final, eternal guru guiding the lives and practices of the religion’s adherents. The Guru Granth Sahib is central to Sikh devotion and worship.
Adi Granth
The Adi Granth—the first religious text of the Sikhs—was compiled by Guru Arjan, the fifth guru, from his own teachings and those of his predecessors. He completed the work in 1604 and made copies for Sikh disciples across India. Unlike the foundational texts for most world religions, the original copy of this holy book still exists and is kept at a gurdwara in Kartarpur.
Guru Granth Sahib
Rather than name a human successor, Guru Gobind Singh declared in 1708 that the Sikh scriptures would be the final guru. He added religious writings by Guru Tegh Bahadur to the existing Adi Granth to complete the 
 scriptures. The Guru Granth Sahib contains 5,894 hymns across 1,430 pages, including spiritual content from Hindu and Muslim teachers in addition to the teachings of the gurus. Every gurdwara has a central copy of Guru Granth Sahib, which was originally written in Gurmukhi, a special Punjabi script.
Dasam Granth
Guru Gobind Singh composed a large number of poems and hymns, but he refused to allow them to be compiled in the Guru Granth Sahib once he declared it his successor. The Dasam Granth is a collection of his writings, which was assembled in the years after his death. Though many of these compositions are used in Sikh liturgy—including the daily nitnem prayers and the Amrit Sanchar baptism ceremony—some Sikhs dispute that the entirety of the work was written by Guru Gobind Singh and attribute parts of it to his court poets. In print, the Dasam Granth is 1,428 pages.
TO BE SIKH
 “Of all the religions, the best religion is to repeat God’s name and do pious deeds.” —Guru Arjan
Rehat Maryada
The Rehat Maryada
 is the Sikh code of conduct, approved in the mid-twentieth century by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, an elected committee of Sikh leaders in Northern India. This document standardizes individual practices for Sikhs around the world, as well as rules for gurdwara services, festivals, and other ceremonies.
COMMUNITY OR SEPARATISM
The Sikh religion offers many positive teachings to the world: a deep sense of community, a focus on selfless service, and an individual code of conduct based on simplicity, honesty, and humility. Moreover, Sikhs are committed to social justice and defense of the innocent. Sikhism is one of the world’s most inclusive and egalitarian religions, with very little discrimination based on gender, class, or race. People of any faith are welcome in the Sikh gurdwara, and Sikhs do not seek to convert others—anyone who worships one God is respected as a believer on the same spiritual journey as a Sikh. With few rituals and no priests, it is a religion led by the community.
The Sikh connection to its traditional homeland in the Indian state of Punjab, where Sikhs are a majority population, engendered a separatist movement against India’s government in the late twentieth century. Known as the Khalistan movement
 , this liberation campaign often turned to militancy and terrorist tactics, including suicide bombings, the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984, and the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in 1985. Sikh nationalism has since lost much of its support, but pro-Khalistan movements still exist within India and the Sikh communities of Europe and North America. The saint-soldier emphasis within Sikhism—especially as related to the defense of the faith—likely contributed to the violent tactics of the Khalistan movement.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
Sikhs have no sacraments, no priestly class, and little ritual. Their worship primarily involves listening to readings from the Guru Granth Sahib, singing hymns, and sharing a meal at the gurdwara.
Gurdwara
A Sikh temple is called a gurdwara
 , which means “place of God” or “house of the guru.” There are no altars, statues, or idols in a gurdwara, but each features a central hall called the Darbar Sahib
 , which contains a copy of the Guru Granth Sahib. Most gurdwaras house a free community kitchen known as a langar
 , which prepares and serves a daily community meal.
Langar Service
Believing all people in the world were equal regardless of caste, religion, or gender, Guru Nanak—the first Sikh guru—began the tradition of serving a vegetarian meal daily as part of worship at each gurdwara. No one is turned away from this meal. Members of all social statuses eat together sitting on the floor.
Religious Gatherings
Sikh worship primarily involves listening to readings from the Guru Granth Sahib, singing hymns, and sharing a meal at the gurdwara. While no day of the week is devoted to communal worship, many Sikhs in Western countries may meet on Sundays. Regardless, gurdwaras are typically open seven days a week and offer worship services each day.
Granthi
Sikhs do not believe that priests or other intermediaries between humans and God are necessary. However, every gurdwara has a male or female granthi
 , or caretaker, who reads from the Guru Granth Sahib and performs duties related to it, like keeping it covered in protective rumala
 , or cloths. It can never be touched with unwashed hands, nor may it touch the floor.
AN UNPARALLELED HOLY BOOK
Buddha left behind no written words, Muhammad didn’t personally write the Quran, Confucius likely didn’t write down his aphorisms, and Jesus Christ didn’t write the Christian scriptures. Compare those traditions to Sikhism. The Sikh gurus preserved their own teachings in the Adi Granth, now known as the Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Arjan and Guru Gobind Singh oversaw the compilation, copying, and distribution of these works. In fact, the original copy of Guru Arjan’s Adi Granth exists not as a copy but in its original form in Kartarpur, India.
As the British scholar and translator Max Arthur Macauliffe once wrote, “Many of the great teachers the world has known have not left a line of their own composition and we only know what they taught through tradition or second-hand information… . But the compositions of Sikh Gurus are preserved … and we know at first-hand what they taught.”
Sevadar
At the gurdwara, a volunteer known as the sevadar
 will wave a chaur sahib
 —a fan or brush made from peacock feathers or yak hair—above the Guru Granth Sahib as a sign of respect while undertaking simran. This is considered a work of seva
 , or selfless service.
Karah Prashad
Part of Sikh worship involves the sharing of karah prashad
 , a specially prepared pudding-like food made with flour, water, sugar, and ghee
 (clarified butter). All who are present in the gurdwara’s main hall can partake of it—Sikhs believe no one who enters the presence of the guru should leave empty-handed.
Darbar Sahib
The Darbar Sahib
 is the main hall of a gurdwara, where the Guru Granth Sahib rests on a prominent throne. Upon entering this room, Sikhs must cover their heads and remove their shoes. They walk with humility toward 
 the holy book, say the Ardas, and place an offering of coins in a chest near it. They then bow by touching their foreheads to the ground, before moving elsewhere in the hall for teaching or singing. Often, Sikhs will segregate by gender, but this is not a strict rule.
Prayer
Sikhs practice simran
 , or “remembrance,” a meditative repetition of the name of God (“Waheguru”). This process is thought to calm the mind and help the adherent connect to the divine. Repeating God’s name brings worshippers into God’s presence and helps them live according to hukam
 (God’s will). Simran can be performed individually or in a group setting at any time of the day, though it usually takes place in the morning.
Three times a day, Sikhs recite five gurbanis
 , or passages from the Guru Granth Sahib. This recitation is known as nitnem , which means “daily habit.” The standard morning nitnem comprises five gurbanis, the evening nitnem one. The nighttime nitnem involves reading one passage in bed prior to sleep.
Before undertaking a task, Sikhs may pray a formal prayer known as the Ardas
 . Sikhs stand, fold their hands, and offer this supplication for God’s protection and blessing and for the welfare of mankind.
COMMON PRAYER: THE ARDAS
Sikhs recite a lengthy prayer in Punjabi known as the Ardas
 , asking for divine assistance before performing an important task. An English translation includes the following request:
Waheguru!
O true King, O beloved Father, we have sung the sweet hymns, we heard Your life-giving Word and have meditated on Your many blessings. May these things find a loving place in our hearts and serve to draw our souls ever closer to You. May all the silent prayers of our hearts be fulfilled by Your grace
Amrit Sanchar
The Amrit Sanchar
 is a Sikh baptism ceremony introduced by Guru Gobind Singh when he founded the Khalsa order. While a Sikh can submit to initiation at any age, most Sikh boys and girls undergo this rite upon reaching adulthood. It requires the presence of six Sikhs and may be administered by any male or female Sikh. They drink a portion of sugar water called amrit
 , which is also sprinkled on their eyes and hair.
Marriage Rituals
The Sikh wedding ritual is known as Anand Karaj
 and requires both the bride and groom to profess the Sikh faith. It may be performed in a gurdwara or any home with an installation of the Guru Granth Sahib. Traditionally, the groom arrives by horseback and meets the family of the bride, and then the two families recite the Ardas prayer. The groom brings an offering of a silk covering for the Guru Granth Sahib, then the bride and groom sit while the officiate—who may be the local granthi or another Sikh man or woman—reads the four stanzas of the Lavan, a hymn written by Guru Ram Das. After each stanza, the bride and groom each hold an end of a single sash while circling the Guru Granth Sahib clockwise, until the hymn is complete. All in attendance then stand to recite the Ardas, and karah prashad
 is distributed to conclude the ceremony.
Sin
The Five Thieves (lust, rage, greed, attachment, and ego; see here
 ) are the primary vices in Sikhism; they prevent a soul from achieving unity with Waheguru. Ego is considered the root cause of most evil.
Repentance
Purification or atonement from evil comes only from within. Sikhs are simply expected to work to subdue those impulses on the path toward liberation. Prayer, meditation on Waheguru, selfless service (seva
 ), and pursuit of the Five Virtues can help overcome negative actions and the temptations of the Five Thieves.
Music
Sikh services are often filled with congregational singing, accompanied by harmoniums and drums. The songs are hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib, sung in Punjabi and led by musicians known as ragis
 . Sikhs believe music is an especially fruitful way to express devotion. Kirtan plays a significant role in the life and worship of a Sikh.
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
In the mid-sixteenth century, Guru Amar Das, the third Sikh guru, began assimilating existing Hindu festivals into the practices of the growing Sikh community. Today these are known as gurpurbs
 , which are festivals celebrating the birth or death of a guru, and melas
 , regular community festivals and parades.
BIRTH OF GURU GOBIND SINGH (JANUARY 5)
Also known as Parkash Utsav Dasveh Patshah
 , or “Celebration of the Tenth Divine Light,” this festival observes the birth of the final human guru. As with the celebration of Guru Nanak’s birthday, which takes place in November, Sikhs gather for forty-eight-hour readings of the Guru Granth Sahib, a ritual known as Akhand Path
 . The event is also marked by parades, religious banners, devotional singing, and stories about the guru’s life.
MAGHI (JANUARY)
A festival commemorating the Battle of Muktsar, during which forty deserters abandoned Guru Gobind Singh, then rejoined him in battle against the Mughal Empire. All forty were killed in the battle, but they were blessed by the guru and cremated. Maghi coincides with Makar Sankranti
 , a Hindu winter harvest festival.
HOLA MOHALLA (MARCH)
A single-day festival that occasionally coincides with the New Year, at the end of a weeklong event at Anandpur Sahib, where Guru Gobind Singh instituted the Khalsa order. The festival highlights military-style competitions and simulated battles, and coincides with Holi, the Hindu festival of colors.
VAISAKHI (APRIL 14)
A celebration of the founding of the Khalsa brotherhood and adoption of the Sikh identity in 1699, this event is marked by gurdwara services before dawn, followed by a parade. Celebrants wear new clothing and fly triangular tasseled flags. Vaisakhi coincides with the Punjabi harvest festival.
MARTYRDOM OF GURU ARJAN (JUNE 16)
A remembrance day for the 1606 death of the fifth guru, Guru Arjan, at the hands of the Mughal Empire after he refused to convert to Islam. Sikhs gather at gurdwaras for this summertime festival.
BANDI CHHOR DIVAS (OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER)
Coinciding with the Hindu festival Diwali, the Bandi Chhor Divas commemorates the release of Guru Har Gobind, the sixth guru, from imprisonment by the Mughal emperor Jahangir in 1619. On this day, Sikhs decorate their homes with candles and attend gurdwara services.
GURU NANAK GURPURAB (NOVEMBER)
During this three-day celebration of the birth of Guru Nanak, Sikhs light candles, shoot fireworks, and gather in gurdwaras for a forty-eight-hour reading of the Guru Granth Sahib. The gurdwara in Nankana Sahib, Pakistan—the city where Guru Nanak was born and a popular pilgrimage site—plays a prominent role.
MARTYRDOM OF GURU TEGH BAHADUR (NOVEMBER 22)
This day commemorates the death of Guru Tegh Bahadur, who refused to convert to Islam and was publicly beheaded in Delhi, India, in 1675.
DIVISIONS
Over the centuries, several distinct groups have broken away from orthodox Sikhism. Their reasons vary—from beliefs about guru succession to appearance requirements and even intensity of devotion.
Namdharis
Orthodox Sikhs believe that Guru Gobind Singh appointed Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh holy book, to be his successor upon his passing in 1708. However, Namdhari Sikhs believe Guru Gobind Singh did not actually die in 1708, but secretly lived to the age of 146 before passing the mantle to Balak Singh—who then named a new line of successors, including Ram Singh. While most historians believe that Ram Singh died in 1885, Namdharis believe he is still living, an eternal guru who will someday return. Namdharis maintain the primary articles of the faith and follow the Guru Granth, but dress differently from other Sikhs, tying white turbans around their heads horizontally and abstaining from black or blue colors.
Nirankaris
This movement began with Baba Dyal Singh during the reign of the Sikh Empire in the early nineteenth century. He felt the Empire’s military achievements distracted Sikhs from the pursuit of God. Baba Dyal Singh emphasized the teachings of Guru Nanak over other gurus, and believed that the growing acceptance of former Hindus into Sikhism was causing a shift toward idolatry. The name of this sect comes from Baba Dyal Singh’s teachings on God’s formless quality (nirankar
 ). Today Nirankaris only differ from mainstream Sikhs in their lack of reverence for the succession of gurus after Guru Nanak.
THERE IS BUT ONE GOD
 “There is but one God. True is his name, creative his personality, and immortal his form. He is without fear sans enmity, unborn and self-illumined. By the guru’s grace he is obtained.” —Guru Nanak
Nirmalas
The Nirmalas are a scholarly brotherhood of celibate, monastic Sikhs whose teachings and doctrines rely as much on the Hindu Vedas and Puranas as on the Guru Granth Sahib. They follow the ten gurus but do not consider the Amrit Sanchar baptism ceremony to be compulsory. Members of this sect are easily distinguished by the mostly orange garments in which they dress. This movement originated with a group of devout followers chosen to learn Sanskrit by Guru Gobind Singh.
Akhand Kirtani Jatha
This offshoot began in the 1930s, led by Bhai Sahib Randhir Singh, a revolutionary against the British Empire. His followers do not believe kesh
 , or uncut hair, is one of the Five Ks, though they still follow the rest of that tradition. In place of kesh, they observe keski
 , or the wearing of a small turban by both men and women beneath their larger turban. While all Sikhs value kirtan
 , or hymn singing, this sect considers it the highest form of spiritual devotion.
Sahajdharis
Sahajdharis aren’t a true splinter group or sect, but rather Sikhs who practice the faith without being initiated into the Khalsa. They haven’t taken the surname Singh, and they exempt themselves from the kesh obligation despite following all other Sikh teachings and doctrines. The practice dates back to periods of intense Sikh persecution, when wearing long hair or a beard was an invitation for death, or when it might require abandoning the status of a higher caste. This category encompasses Sikh adherents born into non-Sikh families as well as Sikhs who someday aspire to follow the Five Ks—just not yet. Sahajdharis are respected by orthodox Sikhs who see them as walking a gradual path to 
 Sikhism, believing it is better not to commit fully to the Khalsa code of conduct than to commit only to stray from that code. Many Sahajdhari families pledge to raise their firstborn son as a fully initiated Sikh.
INTO THE FUTURE
Barely more than 500 years old, Sikhism is still a relatively new religion in human history, yet those five centuries have been difficult ones. Members of a minority religion in a landscape dominated by Hinduism and Islam, Sikhs have suffered persecution from both faiths, have lost their homeland of Punjab, and are often treated as second-class citizens in India. Despite the many attractive qualities of the Sikh religion— inclusiveness, hospitality, egalitarianism, and selfless service—Sikhs’ unique appearance and identity sets them apart from others and has often led to misunderstandings. They are frequent victims of anti-Muslim hate crimes in the United States and Europe, despite having no real connection to Islam. The Sikh holocausts of 1746 and 1762 nearly wiped out the religion altogether.
Yet a population of more than 25 million followers worldwide makes Sikhism one of the world’s largest religions. Its belief that God rewards human kindness and good deeds regardless of one’s religion makes it uniquely suited to thrive in a pluralistic religious society. Its focus on justice, equality, and community welfare put Sikhism in line with many of the more progressive values of the Western world. In fact, few religious scholars deny that the spread of Sikh values would make the world a better place. Sikhism is positioned to grow, but the religion’s own distaste for mission work and proselytizing may prevent its spread.TAOISM
Few world religions are as difficult to describe as Taoism. It is both a philosophy promoting inaction and a system of religious practices. Only legends exist about its founder, Laozi, and in fact, most modern scholars doubt he actually existed. Laozi’s esoteric teachings explain that life’s purpose is alignment with a mysterious force called the Tao
 , while also declaring that the Tao is indefinable. Laozi proclaimed the Tao easy to understand and, at the same time, warned it was too difficult to comprehend. In the Tao Te Ching
 , he wrote that his teachings were simple to follow … and impossible to follow.
Despite these contradictions and the unknowable nature of the Tao, the teachings of Laozi and those who came after him have proven hugely influential in China’s religious history. Over the years, these concepts blended with other religious teachings—including those of Confucianism and Buddhism—to create a diverse, complex religious landscape. The philosophical foundations of Taoism, including a reverence for nature and the quest for balance and order, remain deeply embedded in China’s present.
GOING WITH THE FLOW
The sixth century BCE
 brought immense changes to the world’s religious landscape. In India, Buddhism and Jainism were on the verge of emerging from Hinduism. To the west, the first Greek philosophers had begun formulating their theories of the world around them. Zoroaster was introducing a new monotheism to Persia. And, in the East, two great teachers in China began teaching the way of the universe from opposite perspectives. The first, Confucius, was a young man. The other was Laozi, whose name means “Old Master.” The ancient Chinese revered old age, and, according to legend, this sage was an old man at birth.
At the time, China’s people practiced folk polytheism, offering sacrifices to an interchangeable list of major gods and minor local deities. They prayed to these beings for favorable weather or other blessings. However, neither Confucius nor Laozi seemed interested in the worship of supernatural beings.

Confucius turned his attention to human behavior, teaching about the hierarchy of social relationships between parents and children, husbands and wives, and rulers and subjects. Laozi sought a much broader understanding of the universe, insisting that an eternal force called the Tao
 , or the “way of nature,” animated the environment. It flowed through history like an unchanging river, and human effort had no bearing on its power. Life’s goal was to live simply, in alignment with the current of the Tao rather than against it. The distractions of materialism would disrupt that. Selfish ambition or anger would obstruct it too. Even religious ceremonies were unnecessary. Only quiet humility alongside the Tao—submission to what the river of life brought one’s way—would bring virtue and good health.
According to Laozi’s original teachings, the result of this approach would be a long and fulfilling life. But his followers took this philosophy further. In the coming centuries, Taoism would transform into a religion. Its adherents blended Laozi’s ideals with the surrounding religious polytheism. Rather than striving for a long life, they pursued immortality. Laozi’s original philosophy of inaction became one marked by rituals, offerings, magic elixirs, and other religious pursuits.
MAJOR FIGURES
Taoism’s primary religious leaders lived many centuries ago, beginning with founder Laozi. Its major figures predominantly appeared during China’s classical age.
Laozi
Laozi (also called Lao-Tzu or Lao-Tze) was the founder of Taoism and the traditional author of the Tao Te Ching
 . As early as the first century BCE
 , historians had lost most of the details of his life, but several accounts indicate he was a scholar in the court of the Zhou dynasty around the sixth century BCE
 . Laozi was noted for his wisdom, and according to legend, the young Confucius visited him for advice. Another legend states that Laozi, realizing the Zhou dynasty was nearing an end, left his position and headed west. At the Xiangu pass, a guard asked Laozi for wisdom. There, the old man wrote the Tao Te Ching
 ; he was never seen again. Later Taoist traditions began to revere Laozi as a god or personification of the Tao.
LAOZI MEETS CONFUCIUS
According to Chinese lore, the lives of the sages Confucius and Laozi overlapped, their rival philosophies developing side by side in China. In one account, the young Confucius had heard of Laozi’s wisdom and journeyed to ask questions of the sage. How important are religious rituals? What is the ideal relationship between rulers and their people?
 As Confucius shared his worldview with Laozi and suggested it was important to look to the past for answers, the elder Laozi rebuked him. Those were the views of the proud, the sage proclaimed. Confucius needed humility. This statement left the young teacher bewildered. Upon traveling home, Confucius told his disciples that he understood birds, fish, and animals, but Laozi was a mystery—a dragon that rides the wind into heaven.
Zhuangzi
A philosopher in the fourth century BCE
 , Zhuangzi (also known as Zhuang Zhou or Chuang Tzu) wrote the second most important Taoist text, which bears his name. Zhuangzi is known for his instructional parables and poems. He taught that an individual’s life should be in alignment with, not in opposition to, nature and the Tao.
Zhang Daoling
Zhang Daoling was the second-century founder of the Way of the Celestial Masters movement in Taoism. A student of Taoism, Zhang Daoling was serving as a magistrate during the Han dynasty when he received a revelation from Laozi, who proclaimed him the first Celestial Master and instructed him to guide the people through an impending apocalypse, followed by a great period of peace. Once Zhang conveyed this message, a movement evolved around him, his son, and grandson. This grew into a full-scale campaign against the Han dynasty. Known as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice
 (a reference to the requirements one had to meet in order to join), the rebellion eventually gained authority over the Hanzhong area. Zhang’s teachings about health and his commentary on the Tao Te Ching
 became enormously influential.
Zhang Sanfeng
A cultural hero throughout China, Zhang Sanfeng was a possibly legendary twelfth-century Taoist monk revered for his ascetic lifestyle, his contribution to martial arts, and for achieving immortality or a 200-year lifespan (accounts vary). He is popularly credited with the development of tai chi
 , a form of martial arts known for its slow, deliberate movements. However, most historical records indicate that the art developed centuries later.
Ursula K. Le Guin
Ursula K. Le Guin was a prominent twentieth-century American fantasy and science-fiction author and one of the best-known Taoists outside China. In addition to novels like The Telling
 , an allegory about the suppression of Taoism in Chairman Mao’s China, Le Guin published a modern English translation of the Tao Te Ching
 , with commentary, in 1998.
Benjamin Hoff
Benjamin Hoff was an American author, tai chi instructor, and longtime student of Asian culture. He wrote the best-selling books The Tao of Pooh
 and The Te of Piglet
 in the 1980s and 1990s, using A. A. Milne’s classic characters to introduce the principles of Taoism to the uninitiated. These simple books became widely popular among Western readers, despite some criticism from Taoist scholars.
YIN, YANG, AND THE FIVE ELEMENTS
Harmony and balance are important concepts in Taoism, and the dualist taijitu icon—a version of the interlocking divided circle English speakers know as a “yin-yang”—often symbolizes the faith. Like the interplay between shadow and daylight, the opposites yin
 (darkness, femininity, death) and yang
 (brightness, masculinity, growth) work together to form a unified whole. This idea is central to both Taoism and Confucianism.
Connected to this belief is the Taoist understanding of nature’s expression in the wu xing
 , or the Five Elements. Taoism identifies fire, earth, metal, water, and wood as the foundational components of all the world’s substances. The harmony of the natural world—including the interactions between people—results from the relationships between the Five Elements and the flow of energy (qi
 ) between them.
MAJOR TENETS
For centuries, Taoism has taken two forms, finding expression as a philosophy as well as a religion. Both forms involve the pursuit of the Tao and the peace that comes from life in harmony with it.
Creation and Nature
According to the Tao Te Ching
 , the unchanging, primordial Tao existed before anything else. It gave birth to the universe and to qi
 , the invigorating life energy that animates everything in existence, including the contrasting energies of yin
 and yang
 (see sidebar here ). Together, the yin-yang relationship and qi formed all the elements in the natural world. Viewing nature as a pure expression of the Tao, adherents hold a deep respect for the environment. They believe humans must submit to the natural world; it cannot be overcome or bent to our will.
TO BE TAOIST
“The Tao is like a well: used but never used up. It is like the eternal void: filled with infinite possibilities. It is hidden but always present. I don’t know who gave birth to it. It is older than God.”
— the Tao Te Ching
Deities
Though the Tao is viewed as ultimate reality— Taoists often speak of it like a Westerner might speak of God—the religion has borrowed deities from other cultures and China’s own folk beliefs. Among these beings, Taoists revere the Three Pure Ones, a sort of trinity of celestial gods: Yuqing
 , the highest Jade Emperor and source of learning; Shangqing
 , the Supreme Pure One who reveals the Tao to humans; and Taiqing
 , the Grand Pure One and a manifestation of Laozi.
Another prominent deity is Xi Wangmu, who is known by a number of names, including the Heavenly Empress, the Queen Mother of the West, and Yaochi Jinmu (the “Golden Mother of the Shining Lake”). Xi Wangmu is mentioned in the Zhuangzi
 , but existed in Chinese mythology before Taoism. She has traditionally been worshipped as the protector of all Taoist women.
Other divine figures include legendary Tao teachers thought to have achieved immortality. Adherents adopt these figures as personal gods of sorts and pray to them for daily assistance.
THE EIGHT IMMORTALS
 In Chinese mythology, the Eight Immortals are mythical, saint-like figures believed to have earned immortality. Revered by Taoists, these figures are often identified with elements of nature. They are Han Xiangzi
 (sun), Lan Caihe
 (moon), Cao Guojiu
 (thunder), He Xiangu
 (wood), Li Tieguai
 (water), Lu Dongbin
 (fire), Zhang Guolao
 (volcano), and Zhongli Quan
 (hurricane). Art depicting the Eight Immortals—often grouped together in a boat—first appeared during the twelfth century.
Scriptures
The main texts of Taoism are the Tao Te Ching
 , written by founder Laozi, and the Zhuangzi
 , written by a philosopher of the same name. The former is a short, esoteric book describing the Tao and an individual’s response to it. The latter uses imaginative parables and stories to expand upon Laozi’s original teachings.
Tao
Rather than revolving around a deity or scripture, Taoism centers on the Tao itself. Translated as “the way” or “the path,” the Tao is not an object, but rather the inscrutable truth of the universe. It is the eternal, unchanging principle that orders and sustains the natural world. Zhuangzi described the relationship of humans to the Tao as being similar to the relationship of fish to water: It is what simply is. The proper way to live is in submission to the Tao and in harmony with its flow.
Wu Wei
Wu wei
 is the Taoist goal of inaction or “non-doing” in relation to the Tao. A life attuned to the Tao appears spontaneous, flexible, and natural. Nothing is contrived. Strategies or plans are avoided. All is natural and effortless in response to the flowing of the Tao. Wu wei brings harmony and is sometimes translated as “without control.”
Ethics
Taoism doesn’t define actions as good or evil, but rather in terms of maintaining harmony between humans and the natural order of things. However, taking action itself—intervening in a circumstance—is viewed as more likely to do harm than good. For a Taoist, moral behavior means preventing 
 selfish desires or other obligations from forcing action. That said, the basic tenets of Taoism tend to parallel other religious ethics. Kind and generous behaviors align with the Tao. Non-harmonious behaviors, like murder or theft, do not.
The Three Treasures
The sanbao , or “Three Treasures,” are the practical expressions of Laozi’s teachings in the Tao Te Ching
 : compassion or gentleness (qi
 ), frugality or simplicity (jing
 ), and humility (bugan wei tianxia xian
 ). These characteristics are considered vital in a submissive relationship with the Tao.
Longevity and Immortality
Taoism’s reverence for harmony with nature led to an interest in developing a harmonious relationship with the body itself. Viewing the Tao as a gateway to physical health, Taoists saw natural remedies and exercise as a way to achieve a long life. Chinese culture has always valued old age, and over the centuries, the Taoist interest in longevity evolved into the pursuit of immortality. Taoists practiced yoga, meditation, and even alchemy to realize that goal, resulting in many of the herbal remedies and discoveries of Chinese medicine.
Salvation/Liberation
The primary focus of Taoism is a present life in harmony with the Tao. Salvation is not necessary, nor are particular behaviors identified as sinful or evil. Any ideas related to karma or liberation among Taoists result from Buddhist influence.
Death
The Tao Te Ching
 offers no real teachings about what happens after death. The earliest forms of Taoism were more preoccupied with the cultivation of a long life than with what happened beyond the grave. In some traditions, death itself was considered the gateway to immortality and the next step in achieving unity with the Tao.
What rituals did develop regarding death were borrowed from other faiths and confined to the religious practice of Taoism. Following a death, the deceased are mourned—sometimes loudly—in a multiday vigil. Families depend on a Taoist priest to perform death rites meant to ward off evil spirits. Coffins are used for burial and sometimes filled with offerings, food, “spirit money” called joss paper
 , and other gifts thought to be necessary for a satisfying afterlife or rebirth.
HUNGRY GHOSTS
 People who perish from violent or unhappy circumstances may turn into hungry ghosts. These demon-like beings can cause sickness or other misfortune in the natural world. In modern China, Taoists give offerings to appease these spirits during an annual Hungry Ghost Festival (see sidebar here
 ).
Afterlife
Taoism has no single view of the afterlife apart from the influence of Buddhism and the ancestor worship that developed within Chinese folk religion. Buddhist ideas about rebirth, karma, and the need to accrue merit gradually entered the religion. These concepts introduced the idea of a heaven-like paradise and influenced the Taoist belief in both ghosts and the continuing importance of deceased ancestors. Diyu
 , the underworld of ancient Chinese mythology, became associated with both Buddhism and Taoism as a multilayered realm of punishment for souls prior to reincarnation.
The End of Time
As a philosophical system, Taoism’s emphasis on the present life dampened any apocalyptic or eschatological speculation. However, in the fourth and fifth centuries, myths within religious Taoism began to predict a messianic leader called Li Hong—possibly an avatar of Laozi—who would arrive near the end of the world to create a utopian society governed by inaction, or wu wei
 . In the following centuries, a number of prophets identifying themselves as Li Hong appeared within China.
Worship/Practice
Other than disciplines that assist in a balanced, harmonious life—including meditation and incense offerings—little is required of Taoists in terms of devotional practice. 
 Outside the monastic community, greater emphasis is given to inaction, or wu wei
 , than to rituals or religious practices.
FENG SHUI
The elaborate Chinese system of feng shui
 , which means “wind and water,” has a deep connection to Taoism and its emphasis on harmony with nature. Part philosophy and part art, feng shui helps determine the proper locations for buildings, temples, and homes in balance with the natural world—and therefore the Tao. In addition to the placement of structures, feng shui orients furnishings and landscape design to promote the flow of energy through and around a building. While feng shui is not exclusive to Taoism, the arrangement and use of the Taoist concept of wu xing
 —the five natural elements (fire, earth, metal, water, and wood)—play integral roles in the practice.
MAJOR TEXTS
The authorship of the two central books of Taoism has long been disputed by scholars. Were they the work of a single philosopher/teacher or compilations of wisdom from many sources? Regardless of the answer, the Tao Te Ching
 and the Zhuangzi
 remain the foundational sacred texts of the religion.
Tao Te Ching
This short book, traditionally ascribed to Laozi, identifies the Tao and describes how to live in harmony with it by submitting to the path of least resistance, like water flowing in a stream. Struggling against the movement of the Tao, it teaches, is a useless endeavor. Tao Te Ching
 means “The Way and Its Power,” and the text contains eighty-one very brief chapters. Most scholars believe Laozi was a legendary figure and attribute the Tao Te Ching to multiple authors. Along with the Bible and the Quran, the Tao Te Ching
 is one of the most-translated books in the world.
SAMPLE TEACHING: THE WORDS OF LAOZI
The following comes from chapter eight of the Tao Te Ching
 . It embodies the concept of living life attuned to the Tao:
In dwelling, live close to the ground.
In thinking, keep to the simple.
In conflict, be fair and generous.
In governing, don’t try to control.
In work, do what you enjoy.In family life, be completely present.
Zhuangzi
The second most important book in Taoism, the Zhuangzi
 was written by a philosopher of the same name. The Zhuangzi
 dates from around the third century BCE
 and includes thirty-three chapters of anecdotes, parables, and fables that illustrate a life of spontaneity and inaction in relationship to the Tao. As with the Tao Te Ching
 , most scholars believe the Zhuangzi
 is not the work of a single individual but a collection of teachings from several sources.
Daozang
Also known as the Taoist Canon, this compilation contains more than 1,400 texts written after the Tao Te Ching
 and Zhuangzi
 , including commentaries based on those two primary texts. Like the Tripitaka (“three baskets”) of the Buddhist Pali Canon, the Taoist Canon is subdivided into “three grottoes,” or sandong
 , of twelve books each. They are loosely arranged around teachings on meditation, rituals, and exorcisms of kuei
 , or “hungry ghosts.” Four official versions of the Daozang were produced, beginning with the first compilation around the start of the fifth century. Subsequent dynasties added teachings in 748, 1016, and 1444.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
Because living in harmony with the Tao necessitates inaction or non-doing (wu wei
 ), rituals tend to be deemphasized within philosophical Taoism. Still, certain disciplines are viewed as helpful in promoting balance, health, and harmony. Several distinct practices also emerged within religious Taoism.
Priests
Taoshi
 are priests who, according to their tradition, may live in a monastery or temple (in the Quanzhen school, which requires celibacy) or at home within a community (in the Zhengyi school, which requires priests to be married). Priests are not viewed as leaders of a congregation, but rather as specialists in the rituals of Taoism, which they learn during a lengthy apprenticeship. They also create talismans and conduct complex ceremonies like chiao.
Meditation
Mindfulness and contemplation are traditional practices that empty the mind, separate one from the material world, and engender harmony with the Tao. The Tao Te Ching
 teaches the importance of attaining stillness by focusing on the breath.
Temples
Taoist temples and smaller shrines exist throughout China, most of which belong to the Quanzhen school. These ornate structures often feature copies of the Tao Te Ching
 and Zhuangzi , incense burners, and environmental features—like water or gardens—that foster meditation and a connection to the natural order. Many also have statues of Laozi and gods.
Religious Gatherings
Apart from cultural festivals or individual visits to Taoist temples, Taoism does not promote community religious gatherings.
Chiao
Chiao
 is a large, community-wide ceremony, most often occurring within the Zhuangzi tradition, in which people make offerings to reconnect with a particular deity and renew blessings. A chiao may be performed on a regular basis (every three or five years) to ensure peace, offer gratitude, and promote balance with the Tao. Sometimes a chiao takes place to alleviate a drought or counteract other negative forces. A chiao may involve processions of a god represented by a statue, musical performances, family offerings, and secretive rituals performed by Taoist priests.
Talismans
Throughout the history of Taoism, magical talismans known as fu
 have been used for a variety of purposes. These consist of characters or symbols written on rice paper by specially trained masters. The writing is thought to contain spells or energy—embedded into the 
 writing by a priest—that is unlocked when the paper burns. Taoists pray to a particular god while incinerating the talisman in an incense burner. Adherents believe a talisman may protect a home, improve business, heal diseases, or remove hungry ghosts. Some talismans are worn rather than burned.
Altar
Many Taoists set up altars at home to protect the family from bad spirits and ensure wealth and good health. These contain two candles (representing yin and yang), a lamp (representing the Tao), incense burners, and deity statues purposely arranged in odd numbers to represent the heavenly deities. The statues must be consecrated via a ceremony performed by a Taoist priest.
Baibai
A sacred ritual offering of incense at home or in a temple is known as baibai
 . Taoists believe that the smoke that rises from burned incense sticks conveys wishes and prayers to deities. Incense sticks are burned in threes and offered using the left hand.
Joss Paper
Also known as “spirit money” or “ghost money,” joss paper
 is decorated, handmade paper folded into elaborate shapes and then burned as an offering to ancestors, recently departed relatives, or deities. Adopted by Taoists, this ancient Chinese practice began with the belief that the spirits of ancestors remained in the natural world and could influence the living. Joss papers are gifts to allow these beings to live a comfortable life in the spirit realm.
TO BE TAOIST
 “He who devotes himself to learning (seeks) from day to day to increase (his knowledge); he who devotes himself to the Tao (seeks) from day to day to diminish (his doing).” —chapter 48, the Tao Te Ching
Alchemy
Taoists practice alchemy
 , or transformation, for the purpose of improving their relationship with the Tao. The internal alchemy of neidan
 involves the use of controlled breathing, meditation, yoga, and martial arts like tai chi to bring about mental and physical changes. A more external and mystical alchemy called waidan developed as Taoists attempted to reach immortality by mixing chemicals and natural substances into magical elixirs.
Tai Chi
The ancient Chinese martial art of tai chi has long been associated with Taoism, especially for the physical benefits it provides those in pursuit of health and longevity. The slow, smooth movement of tai chi reflects the teachings of the Tao Te Ching
 about suppleness and balance. While the precise history of tai chi is cloudy, many Taoists claim it originated among Taoist monks.
Man Yue Ceremony
Taoists view birth as merely a transition from one form of life (inside the womb) to another form (outside the womb). For this reason, the period of pregnancy is valued more highly than the actual birth. However, the man yue
 ceremony, in which the baby is presented to the community after its first month of life, is popular among Taoists and other traditional Chinese families. Mothers remain confined at home for the first thirty days after giving birth, eating prescribed foods to assist in the recovery of energy and avoiding certain activities like bathing. The confinement period ends with the man yue
 ceremony, which may take place in a relative’s home or even in a restaurant. Gifts include cakes, gold jewelry, and red-dyed eggs, which symbolize new life.
Marriage Rituals
In a traditional Taoist wedding, the bride and groom face one another while seated on a representation of the bagua
 , or “eight trigrams.” This large octagonal symbol contains the yin-yang
 image along with eight hexagrams depicting the fundamental forces of nature (sky, lake, fire, thunder, wind, water, mountain, earth). The bride sits with a water-filled urn, while the groom sits with a lit candle. Traditionally, both bride and groom wear red. The couple then lights representative candles in each of the eight sections. After reciting Tao scriptures and exchanging vows and rings, the bride’s water is poured onto the groom’s candle, symbolizing the union of two opposite elements. Taoist wedding ceremonies may take place in any setting.
Music/Chants
Music and chanting figure prominently in Taoist temple rituals and festivals, where harmonic tones are viewed as representative of the yin-yang principle. During prayers and specific rites, Taoist priests play instruments including bells, gongs, cymbals, wooden blocks, and drums.
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
Many Taoist festivals have been borrowed and shared among Chinese Buddhism, Confucianism, and general Chinese culture. The celebrations vary according to geography and sect, but play a substantial role in Taoist communities. Because the festivals take place according to the lunar-based Chinese calendar, precise dates shift from year to year.
CHINESE NEW YEAR (JANUARY OR FEBRUARY)
The Chinese New Year is a centuries-old spring festival that begins on the first day of the Chinese calendar and lasts until the Lantern Festival. Chinese citizens gather for traditional dinners, decorate their homes, and light fireworks to frighten away evil spirits. Cleaning the home is an important element of this celebration, due to the belief that bad fortune must be removed to open up space for good fortune in the New Year. Taoists make sure to clean their home altars and statues, burning past decorations and adding new ones. Some Taoists burn paper effigies of Zao Jun, the “kitchen god,” during New Year celebrations. This practice is believed to dispatch the deity to heaven so he can inform the Jade Emperor of the family’s good deeds.
LANTERN FESTIVAL (FEBRUARY OR MARCH)
Occurring on the fifteenth day of the first month in the Chinese calendar, the Lantern Festival
 takes place on the final day of Chinese New Year celebrations, which sometimes last as long as two weeks. This ancient festival dates back two thousand years and once celebrated the reduced darkness brought by the change in seasons. According to tradition, celebrants design 
 elaborate paper lanterns—usually colored red for good luck or prosperity—and hang them in the streets, around homes, and in businesses. Fireworks and lion dancing are another popular element of this celebration. There is a variety of origin stories for the Lantern Festival, some of which have been attached to Tao deities.
TOMB-SWEEPING DAY (APRIL)
Also known as Ancestors’ Day
 or Qingming
 , this public holiday now occurs annually on April 4 or 5 in memory of the death of Chiang Kai-shek, a twentieth-century Chinese nationalist and political leader. Despite this modern revisionism, the holiday dates back several centuries. Celebrants visit the burial places of their ancestors to clean their gravesites, leave offerings of food or tea, or burn joss papers.
HUNGRY GHOST FESTIVAL (JULY OR AUGUST)
Held the fifteenth night of the seventh month of the Chinese calendar, this evening marks a moment during the year when the Chinese believe the realms of the dead open at sunset, allowing the deceased to visit the living. Throughout the entire month—known as Ghost Month
 —Taoists burn incense and joss paper and leave food offerings for all spirits. Unlike the offerings to one’s own ancestors on Tomb-Sweeping Day, these offerings are given to all spirits of the deceased. On the festival night itself, Taoists participate in rituals to ease the suffering of these spirits, who are believed to return to the afterlife at the end of the month.
DIVISIONS
The primary division within Taoism is between philosophical Taoism and religious Taoism. The former relates to one’s understanding of the world, the pursuit of a healthy life, and a harmonious relationship with the Tao. It is largely devoid of ritual. However, religious Taoism drew from traditional Chinese folk religion and developed alongside Buddhism and Confucianism. It adopted deities and the rituals of ancestor worship, took on a number of mystical practices and beliefs, and turned into a complex religious system.
Nevertheless, religious Taoism doesn’t have any formal organization or orthodoxy. Over the centuries, it has divided into two distinct modern traditions, each of which has split further into sects.
Zhengyi
Prominent in rural China and Taiwan, Zhengyi is known as the “southern” form of Taoism and focuses on community rituals like the chiao (see here
 ). Priests are married 
 and live in households within the community. Zhengyi Taoists follow Laozi as a teacher but do not venerate him as a deity. Zhengyi Tao began during the Tang dynasty in seventh- to tenth-century China and claims a lineage with Zhang Daoling and the Celestial Masters.
Quanzhen
Practiced in mainland China, Quanzhen is considered “northern” Taoism and maintains a greater emphasis on monasteries, temples, and the sacred sites of the religion. It includes celibate monastic orders and focuses on individual practices like internal alchemy and the pursuit of immortality. The earliest Quanzhen monastic orders assimilated a number of Buddhist and Confucian disciplines. This branch dates back to the twelfth century.
YIN OR YANG
With its focus on personal humility, contentment, and cooperative relationships, Taoism promotes a number of socially constructive behaviors. Its cultivation of harmony with nature has played a significant role in environmentalist concerns, in China as well as in the West. Taoism values balance and nonaggression, which makes it a very peaceful religion. Taoists accept difficult situations and attempt to handle challenges with flexibility and grace. The pursuit of long life through exercise and healthy eating set Taoists apart in a world where healthy lifestyles are increasingly important. Throughout the long history of China, Taoism has intermingled with Buddhism and ancient folk religions, but its core teachings have remained a stabilizing force.
However, the individual ideal of wu wei
 — “non-doing”—within Taoist philosophy fails to transfer easily to society as a whole, especially when viewed through a lens colored by Western ambition. Many of the advances of modern civilization—from new technologies to widespread social change—resulted from discontentment with the way things are, something Taoism doesn’t encourage or facilitate. Attempting to live in harmony with the apparent “natural order of things” would not have led to the American civil rights movement, for example. Of course, this is a Western perspective, and Taoism is not an American or European religion. Even so, the modernization of China has brought the consumeristic mind-set of Western culture to Taoism’s door, exposing it to significant challenges.
INTO THE FUTURE
As ancient and integrated into China’s culture as it is, religious Taoism barely survived the country’s nineteenth-century Taiping Rebellion—a civil war inspired by the expansion of Christianity—or the oppressive Communist government of the twentieth century. The policies of Chairman Mao Zedong considered Taoism a superstitious and dangerous belief that would weaken China. Many temples were destroyed or closed as a result, but traditional Taoism did experience a slight renaissance in the years after Mao.
Despite China’s massive population, Taoism has relatively few adherents, because not many Chinese residents identify themselves as Taoists anymore, especially the more Western-focused younger generations. Compared to Buddhism and Confucianism, it is seen as a simple, unsophisticated faith. Those who do practice Taoism are also likely to incorporate elements from China’s other prominent religious systems. It’s not uncommon to enter a Chinese temple and be greeted with statues or images of Laozi, Buddha, and Confucius.
Meanwhile, the ideals of philosophical Taoism maintain a strong hold on Chinese life and culture, from the practice of feng shui to China’s long-standing interest in natural medicine and exercise. Religious Taoism may be on the decline, but the spiritual concepts introduced by Laozi are alive and well.JUDAISM
Compared to the enormous populations of Christianity and Islam, Judaism, which has fewer than 20 million adherents, may seem as if it would have a relatively insignificant influence on today’s world. But as the mother faith out of which both Islam and Christianity developed—and one of the world’s oldest monotheistic religions—it remains one of the most influential belief systems.
Judaism is one of humanity’s most unique religions, too. Unlike most faiths, Judaism passes from one generation to the next not by proselytization or conversion, but by blood. Being Jewish is more than just a religious claim. It’s an ethnic claim, too. In fact, many people identify as Jews whether or not they practice the religion.
The emergence and resilience of the faith are also extraordinary. Judaism began as a monotheistic religion surrounded by polytheistic beliefs. From the earliest stories about Abraham, the Jews claimed that there was but one true God—and of all the people on earth, he chose the Jews as his favorites. He would protect and sustain them. Only to the Jews would God personally reveal himself. This relationship was based on a covenant: The people agreed to worship God and obey God’s laws. In return, God agreed to bless the descendants of Abraham forever.
Since then, the Jews have overcome many hardships, including exile, expulsion, persecution, and most notably the Holocaust. Its adherents remain only a small percentage of the world’s population. Nevertheless, the Jewish faith persists.
A COVENANT WITH GOD
According to the Torah—the first five books of the Old Testament—a man named Abram was born in a city called Ur, in modern-day Iraq. His Mesopotamian culture was polytheistic and rife with local deities, so entertaining the idea of one supreme being set Abram apart from the surrounding religions. According to Jewish tradition, God revealed himself to Abram because he was a monotheist, calling him to leave his family and birthplace for the land of Canaan.
Although he would still be among polytheistic beliefs in the land of the Canaanites, Abram obeyed. He and his wife entered the drought-stricken Canaan, where God promised to grant him many descendants who would someday inhabit the land.

■Primary text: Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), Talmud (Mishnah and Gemara)
God established his covenant with Abram, and as a symbol of it, required him and all the males in his household to be circumcised. He then gave Abram a new name: Abraham. Sarai, Abram’s wife, was renamed Sarah. Abraham submitted to the personal circumcision. He also circumcised his son, Ishmael, whom he had with his “secondary wife,” or concubine, Hagar, because his wife Sarah was barren. When she was 90 years old, however, Sarah did conceive and gave birth to a son, Isaac, who was also circumcised. When Isaac reached adulthood, he fathered Jacob and his twin, Esau.
Jacob went on to father twelve sons with four wives. During a journey back to his homeland of Canaan, Jacob spent a full night wrestling with God, who had taken the form of a man. At daybreak, God renamed him “Israel,” meaning “struggle with God,” and his twelve sons went on to become the ancestors of the twelve tribes of Israel.
Centuries later, God called Moses, a member of one of those tribes, to lead the Jewish people out of slavery in Egypt. In the process, God revealed to Moses his true name, YHWH (Yahweh). After the Jews fled Egypt, God gave Moses the Ten Commandments and the foundational laws of the Jewish covenant.
Jewish tradition dates Abraham’s birth to 1813 BCE
 . However, the stories of Genesis— traditionally thought to be authored by Moses, along with the rest of the Torah—were likely not written until the Jews’ exile in Babylon during the sixth century BCE
 . Twelve centuries of oral tradition passed before Abraham’s story was put into writing, which means the existence of the patriarchs cannot be confirmed. Regardless, three of the world’s most significant religious traditions— Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—trace their heritage back to Abraham’s monotheism and his relationship with God.
A MONOTHEISTIC VISION
The authors of the earliest portions of the Hebrew Bible accepted the existence of other gods—for example, the location-based Canaanite deities—but entered a covenant relationship with YHWH, whom they believed to be the greatest of these gods. (The practice of worshipping one deity among many is known as monolatry
 .) But before long, this practice evolved into monotheism: the belief that only one deity existed at all. Even so, Judaism probably wasn’t the first monotheistic religion. That title likely goes to Zoroastrianism, whose prophet Zoroaster (Zarathustra) lived in what is now Iran around 1500 BCE and taught his followers to worship the sole creator Ahura Mazda (see here
 ).
MAJOR FIGURES
The most prominent individuals within the Jewish faith include the patriarchs, biblical leaders, influential rabbis, and politicians.
Abraham
The father of Judaism, Abraham left Ur for Canaan on the instructions of YHWH. Originally called Abram, he had no children and was growing old when God promised the land to his descendants. Abram entered into a covenant with God, received the new name Abraham, and fathered Isaac in his old age. Beginning with Abraham’s household, circumcision of all males was practiced as a sign of this covenant.
Isaac
Isaac was the long-awaited son of Abraham and Sarah, who arrived when his parents were 100 and 90, respectively. Isaac is revered as the first Jew born to Jewish parents, the first to be circumcised in infancy, and the only patriarch to spend his entire life in the land of Israel. Famously, Isaac nearly died during a test of faith early in his life. God asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on an altar as a burnt offering. Just as the father was about to kill his son, God provided a ram to be sacrificed instead. Isaac married Rebecca and fathered the twins Jacob and Esau.
Jacob
Jacob is the third patriarch of Judaism, after Abraham and Isaac, and fathered twelve sons and one daughter. Jacob fought constantly with his twin brother Esau, and through trickery, he received a blessing meant for Esau 
 and fled to his mother’s hometown of Haran. Many years later, while journeying back to Canaan, God approached Jacob disguised as a man and wrestled him throughout the night. At daybreak, God blessed Jacob and renamed him Israel
 —the one who “wrestles with God.” Jacob’s twelve sons became the ancestors of twelve Hebrew tribes, and the Jewish people became known collectively as Israel, or Israelites
Moses
Generations after Jacob, Moses helped the Israelites escape enslavement in Egypt in an event known as the Exodus. God revealed himself to Moses on Mount Sinai and gave him the Ten Commandments, along with the rest of the Torah. Because of this, Moses is generally considered the most important prophet in Judaism, as well as a significant figure in Christianity and Islam. Due to disobedience, however, he and the people of Israel wandered for forty years in the wilderness before returning to the Promised Land of Canaan.
King David
A righteous warrior-king, musician, and psalmist, King David established the kingdom’s capital in Jerusalem. He rose to prominence as a youth for killing the giant Goliath. As king, he became the father of the future king Solomon, among other heirs. Jewish scriptures foretell that a descendant of David, the Messiah, will restore the kingdom of Israel.
THE STAR OF DAVID
For centuries, symbols like the menorah
 or shofar
 (ram’s horn) were used as visual symbols representing the Jewish faith. But in the eighteenth century, Jewish communities in Eastern Europe began using this decorative hexagram—which dates back to medieval Kabbalah texts—as a Jewish icon, in much the same way Christians used the cross. It became popular worldwide after the First Zionist Congress in 1897 chose this image as its symbol.
King Solomon
Crowned Israel’s king around 967 BCE
 , King Solomon, the son of King David, was known for his wealth and wisdom. Solomon composed the Song of Songs, the book of Proverbs, and the book of Ecclesiastes in the Jewish scriptures. Most importantly, he built and dedicated the First Temple in Jerusalem. 
 After his death, the kingdom split into two, and the temple was destroyed four centuries later during the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem.
Hillel the Elder
Hillel the Elder was a famed Jewish sage and scholar who lived from 110 BCE
 to 10 CE
 . Though he worked as a woodcutter, he devoted himself to study of the Torah and became a spiritual leader of the Jewish people during the time of Israel’s King Herod. Hillel is deeply associated with the development of the Talmud and is often contrasted with Shammai.
Shammai
A great first-century Jewish scholar and engineer, Shammai played a significant role in the development of the Talmud. Shammai’s interpretations of the Torah were much stricter than those of his contemporary Hillel. The “houses” or schools of Hillel and Shammai are mentioned frequently in Talmudic stories.
Maimonides/Rambam
A twelfth-century Spanish-born physician, Maimonides became a rabbi, a famed Torah scholar, and one of the foremost philosophers in the history of Judaism. He was primarily known for his Mishneh Torah
 , a fourteen-volume treatise on Jewish law and ethics, which applied Aristotelian philosophy to Jewish thinking. In Hebrew, his name—Rabbeinu Mosheh ben Maimon—formed the acronym RMBM, or “Rambam,” a moniker by which he is sometimes known.
David Ben-Gurion
A Polish Jew and the 1946 head of the World Zionist Organization, David Ben-Gurion played the most prominent role in the establishment of the State of Israel. Known as Israel’s “founding father,” he signed the Israeli Declaration of Independence and proclaimed the nationhood of Israel in 1948. Ben-Gurion helped organize the Israel Defense Forces, guided Israel throughout the Arab-Israeli War, and served as the nation’s first prime minister until 1954.
Golda Meir
Golda Meir was a Ukrainian-born American who became the State of Israel’s fourth prime minister from 1969 to 1974. Prior to that, she served as Israel’s Minister of Labor, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Internal Affairs. An early Zionist who helped raise money to support Israel, Meir was one of only two women to sign the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948. She is often identified as the “grandmother of the Jewish people,” and died in 1978.
Menachem Mendel Schneerson
Menachem Mendel Schneerson was an Orthodox rabbi and a leader within Hasidic Judaism’s Chabad-Lubavitch movement. Under Rabbi Schneerson’s leadership, the small movement expanded throughout the United States and instituted Chabad houses in dozens of countries worldwide, making it 
 the world’s largest Jewish religious organization. Following his death in 1994, Schneerson was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his contributions to American life.
MAJOR TENETS
The majority of Jews share the following fundamental beliefs.
Creation
Because Christianity arose from Judaism, both religions share the same spiritual heritage and some of the same scriptures, including the two-part creation story from the book of Genesis (see here
 ). Jews believe God spoke the universe into being over six days, culminating in the creation of humankind and followed by a day of rest. The first man and woman lived in the Garden of Eden, were tempted by the serpent, rebelled by eating of the forbidden tree, and were banished to a life of toil.
Deity
Represented by four Hebrew letters, YHWH (or Yahweh
 , anglicized as Jehovah
 ) is God’s name as revealed to Abraham, though observant Jews believe this name is too holy to speak or write. Though God is referred to by many different names throughout the Torah, the faithful tend to refer to him as HaShem
 , which means “the name.” This singular God the creator of humanity and the world, and he is incorporeal, omnipresent, omniscient, and eternal.
Scriptures
The first five books of the Hebrew Bible—the Torah—are the primary scriptures of Judaism and are traditionally thought to have been written by Moses. The full Hebrew Bible, which Christians call the Old Testament, is often referred to as the Tanakh
 , an acronym that stands for Torah, Nevi’im (“Prophets”), and Ketuvim (“Writings”). Along with these scriptures, the books of the Tanakh are accompanied by oral commentaries. These are the Mishnah and the Gemara, which together form the Talmud.
Ethics
Basic Jewish ethics derives from the Hebrew Bible as well as the commentaries and teachings of rabbis over the centuries. This morality revolves around respect for God, righteous attitudes, honesty, peace, humility, generosity, compassion for fellow humans, a concern for human dignity, and care for the living creatures of the earth. Other laws include food and dietary rules (kashrut
 ), purity rules, requirements for sacrifices and feasts, and other instructions. According to Jewish tradition, there are 613 mitzvot
 , or commandments, in the Torah.
As with Christianity, central to these rules are the Ten Commandments, the primary ethical commands of Judaism. These laws, written on stone tablets and given to Moses by God, prohibit murder, adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, stealing, lying, and coveting. They promote worshipping God alone, honoring one’s parents, and maintaining the Sabbath as a day of rest.
Salvation
Contrary to the Christian doctrine of “original sin,” Jews do not believe that humans are born into sin. Righteousness comes from obeying the laws of the Torah, and everyone can choose to obey or rebel against these commandments. Jews also do not believe in the need for personal salvation. Salvation is not about attaining paradise in an afterlife, nor is it achievable via a simple decision or particular belief. Salvation means having a healthy relationship with God and with humanity—and depends more on God’s relationship with the entire Jewish nation than a single person. Regardless, faithful Jews are expected to pursue individual morality by following God’s teachings in the Torah.
The Soul
During the act of creation, God formed the first man from the dust of the ground and breathed life into him. The belief in this animating life force, separate from the physical body, gradually evolved into a belief—possibly influenced by Greek philosophy—that the soul is the unique core of a person’s being, containing his or her intelligence, emotions, and identity. While it is linked to the body and requires the body for action, the soul is eternal, and a human’s core being survives in some way after bodily death.
Afterlife and End of Time
The Hebrew Bible is vague on the concept of the afterlife. As a result, Judaism lacks a specific doctrine about what happens after death and remains more focused on an individual’s present existence than anything beyond it. However, the basic teaching is that the soul is eternal—a person’s existence doesn’t end at death. Some Jews believe in a heavenly paradise. Others believe the righteous dead await resurrection when the Messiah arrives, after which they will live in a spiritual “world to come.” Some believe the wicked will be tormented in a hell-like place, while others believe the wicked will simply cease to exist when they die.
Jewish eschatology—theology concerned with the final judgment and end of humanity—revolves around the Jews’ redemption and return to Israel, the arrival of the Messiah from the line of David, the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem, and a peaceful new heaven and new earth that appear when the nations of the world recognize the God of Israel.
TO BE JEWISH
 “That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah; the rest is the explanation; go and learn.” —Rabbi Hillel
Worship/Practice
Jews obey the Torah by gathering for ritual prayer services at a synagogue, observing Shabbat
 (a day of rest, or “Sabbath,” that begins at sunset on Friday through sunset on Saturday), and following Jewish dietary laws, known as kashrut
 , regarding food choice, handling, and preparation. Most forms of work are prohibited during the Sabbath. Jews also follow regular observances, festivals, and celebrations throughout the year (see sidebar here
 ).
MAJOR TEXTS
The Jewish religion is based on the word of God—the covenant offered to Abraham and the patriarchs, the Torah as revealed to Moses and the people of Israel, and the Hebrew Bible as interpreted by scholars and rabbis over the years. Here are some of its sacred writings and commentaries.
The Torah
The Torah, also known as the Pentateuch, comprises the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The word Torah means “instruction” or “law.” Traditionally attributed to Moses, these writings tell the history of God’s covenant with the Jewish people, the exodus from Egypt, and the revelation of the law. Most biblical scholars date its writing to around 600 BCE
 , during the Babylonian Exile.
The Tanakh
The Tanakh is the Jewish name for the full Hebrew Bible, known to Christians as the Old Testament, which tells the full story of God’s relationship with the people of Israel. It includes the five books of the Torah, along with the Nevi’im (“Prophets”), and Ketuvim (“Writings,” including Psalms and Proverbs). Tanakh
 is an acronym for Torah, Nevi’im, and Ketuvim.
Talmud
The most important Hebrew text other than the Bible, the Talmud consists of the Mishnah (a written collection of orally transmitted traditions) and the Gemara (additional commentary on the Mishnah). Along with the Torah, it is the basis for all Jewish law. A standard Hebrew and Aramaic printing of the complete Talmud may be more than 6,000 pages long.
Mishnah
The Mishnah is an authoritative collection of rabbinic writings, based on oral traditions. It contains sections on agriculture, marriage law, civil and criminal law, ritual purity and impurity, offerings and sacrifices, and feasts. The Mishnah is the first section of the Talmud and the earliest work of rabbinical literature, assembled in the second century CE
Halakha
The halakha
 is the body of commandments, or mitzvot
 , taken from the written and oral Torah. These 613 religious laws—which instruct followers, among other things, “to honor the old and the wise,” “not to do work on Shabbat,” and “not to eat the flesh of unclean beasts”—govern all civil and religious Jewish practices.
Midrash
The midrash
 is a set of interpretations and explanations of the Tanakh, as taught by early Jewish rabbis, scholars, and sages. It includes commentary as well as a variety of parables and stories that clarify the texts and even fill in the gaps of hard-to-understand passages. Most midrashim were compiled during the first centuries CE
Haggadah
The primary text read by Jews on the first night of Passover, the Haggadah, or “telling,” relates the story of the Israelites’ slavery in Egypt and the Exodus. It’s a way for Jewish families to pass on their history.
The Mishneh Torah
A popular, accessible fourteen-book guide to Jewish rituals and observance, the Mishneh Torah was written in the twelfth century by the Jewish scholar Maimonides. Other than the sacred scriptures, it remains one of the most significant books in Judaism.
Night
 by Elie Wiesel
Night
 is the Romanian-born journalist Elie Wiesel’s short personal narrative recounting his teenage experience in the death camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald during World War II. One of the most influential accounts of the Holocaust, Night
 has been translated into thirty languages and has sold millions of copies in the United States alone. It is an important piece of literature about the Holocaust, a definitive event in modern Judaism.
The Diary of a Young Girl
 by Anne Frank
The Diary of a Young Girl
 is the posthumously published diary of Anne Frank, a Jewish girl whose family fled from Germany to the Netherlands upon Adolf Hitler’s rise to power. Anne described life in hiding in a secret annex, until her family was discovered and transported to Auschwitz, where Anne died in 1945. Though it is not a theological text, her diary is one of the most popular nonfiction works ever written, revealing the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany and the suffering of nearly one million Jewish children who were victims of the Holocaust.
Souls on Fire
 by Elie Wiesel
Souls on Fire
 contains biographical portraits of Hasidic masters and describes their longing for the Messiah and their larger impact on Judaism. Filled with Hasidic stories and legends, it is considered a masterpiece of Jewish nonfiction.
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
Holy days, festivals, and observances, which occur according to the lunar-based Hebrew calendar, are a significant element of Jewish faith and culture. Particularly in Israel, Jewish-owned shops, restaurants, and businesses close on these special days.
PURIM (FEBRUARY OR MARCH)
Purim is a joyous day of celebration, commemorating the saving of the Jews from annihilation at the hands of ancient Persia, as told in the Book of Esther. It is traditional for Jewish children to dress up on this holiday as characters in the biblical story.
PESACH (MARCH OR APRIL)
Pesach
 is a weeklong observance commemorating the Exodus after generations of slavery in Egypt, an event central to the Jewish identity. Also known as Passover
 , it is one of the most widely observed Jewish holidays worldwide and begins with a symbolic ritual feast known as a seder
YOM HASHOAH (APRIL OR MAY)
Also known as Holocaust Remembrance Day
 , this day is set aside to remember the six million Jews and millions of others who perished in the Holocaust.
YOM HA’ATZMAUT (APRIL OR MAY)
As Israel’s Independence Day, Yom Ha’atzmaut
 commemorates the founding of the State of Israel in 1948.
SHAVUOT (MAY OR JUNE)
Occurring at the end of a seven-week period that starts at Passover, this festival—often called the Feast of Weeks
 —commemorates God’s revelation of the Torah to Moses.
TISHA B’AV (JULY OR AUGUST)
Tisha B’Av is a day of fasting and mourning in which Jews lament the destruction of the First and Second Temples in Jerusalem and their exile from Israel.
ROSH HASHANAH (SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER)
Rosh Hashanah
 , meaning “the head of the year,” is a two-day celebration marking the anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve. It is the first day of a ten-day period of repentance and self-examination. It is often referred to as the Feast of Trumpets
YOM KIPPUR (SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER)
Yom Kippur
 , or the Day of Atonement
 , is the holiest day of the year. Considered the “Sabbath of Sabbaths,” Yom Kippur is a time for fasting, prayer, self-examination, repentance, and reconciliation between individuals and God. It is the last day of the ten-day period beginning with Rosh Hashanah
SUKKOT (SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER)
Sukkot
 is a joyful harvest festival that commemorates the Jews’ forty-year period in the desert after 
 the Exodus. Also known as the Feast of Tabernacles
 or the Feast of Booths
 , this weeklong holiday finds Jews erecting temporary walled structures covered with plant material, called sukkot
 (singular: sukkah
 ), resembling those described in Leviticus 23:42–43. They eat their meals and sometimes sleep in the sukkah.
HANUKKAH (LATE NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER)
Also called the Festival of Lights, Hanukkah
 is an eight-day celebration that recalls the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, at which a one-day supply of oil miraculously burned for eight days during the Maccabean Revolt.
IN THE NAME OF THE LORD
Though it may be small in size, Judaism is one of the world’s oldest religions, and its teachings and religious concepts have spread throughout humankind—through Jewish heritage itself as well as through its relationship to Christianity. A weekly day of rest, basic human freedom and dignity, respect for children, an individual moral code, and communal responsibility for social justice are all are common ideas with roots in the Jewish scriptures. Though the Jewish faith has represented only a small fraction of the world’s population, a dazzling number of the most influential thinkers, writers, artists, and musicians have been Jews.
On the other hand, as described in the Jewish scriptures, God promised the land of Canaan to the people of Israel, but the territory was occupied by others at the time, and God commanded the mass slaughter of these men, women, and children before the Israelites took it over. Many believers excuse these behaviors as requirements of God’s holy justice—the original Canaanites were worshippers of false gods—but religious violence related to the right to dwell in this region has permeated the Middle East ever since. Israel’s belief in its divine right to the territory motivated anti-Roman Jewish zealots during the first century as well as modern-day attacks by Jewish extremists against Palestinian targets.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
While the strictness of Jewish worship varies depending on the tradition in which it is practiced, it remains a highly symbolic and ceremonial part of life. Judaism allows little division between the sacred and secular—all of life is viewed as a form of celebration, liturgy, and relationship with God.
Leaders
Teachers of the Torah, known as rabbis, guide most Jewish communities, doing everything from visiting the sick to preaching sermons. In Orthodox communities, only men may be ordained as rabbis. Other branches of the faith may ordain women.
Houses of Worship
In ancient times, the earliest Jews gathered in a single, central place for worship and ritual sacrifices, believed to be the place where God dwelled. The first such structure was a portable tabernacle used during the Israelites’ period of wandering in the desert after the Exodus from Egypt. King Solomon later built the First Temple in Jerusalem. After it was destroyed, the Second Temple was constructed, only to be destroyed again in 70 CE
 . Its location—the Temple Mount in Jerusalem—remains the holiest site in Judaism.
Modern Jews gather in synagogues for worship and communal prayer. The shapes 
 and design of these buildings vary, but they always contain an elevated platform known as a bimah
 , from which the Torah is read, and a cabinet called the Aron Kodesh
 (“Holy Ark”), which contains the scrolls of the Torah. Often covered by a curtain, this closet-like feature is considered the holiest part of the synagogue.
Religious Gatherings
While Jews can pray anywhere, certain prayers are said in community with other faithful. Jews gather in synagogues to offer these prayers, worship, and study the Torah. Orthodox Jews may assemble in formal worship services daily, with a longer service on the Sabbath. A public prayer service can only take place when at least ten Jewish adults—a minyan
 —are present.
TO BE JEWISH
 “To be a Jew, essentially and not just accidentally, is to regard the Jewish people as one’s sole primal community. Election by the unique God requires total and unconditional loyalty to one people.” —Jewish theologian David Novak
Liturgy
Jewish prayer services are built around certain prayers, including the Shema
 (the Jewish confession of faith) and a section of blessings known as the Amidah , recited while standing. Torah readings are also performed after a ceremonial procession as the scriptures are brought out.
Prayer
Prayer is both a commandment and a daily acknowledgment of God’s presence. Devout Jews pray three times every day (morning, noon, and night) as well as at synagogue, often in Hebrew. Prayers might express gratitude or praise, or recognize a person’s dependence on God. Prayer is also a time of self-evaluation and examination.
Jews often recite prayers from a prayer book, but can also pray in their own words. Often they will sway back and forth during prayer, a mystical practice symbolizing the flickering, upward-reaching flame of a candle.
A COMMON PRAYER: SHEMA YISRAEL
At the center of Jewish prayer is a prayer in the Torah known as the Shema
 . The oldest daily prayer in Judaism, it is based on Deuteronomy 6:4–9. An English translation of the first part of it:
Hear, O Israel: the LORD is our God, the LORD is One
Blessed be the Name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever
And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
And these words that I command you today shall be in your heart
And you shall teach them diligently to your children, and you shall speak of them when you sit at home, and when you walk along the way, and when you lie down and when you rise up
And you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes
And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates
Traditional Accessories
When praying, Jewish men often wear a white-and-blue prayer shawl, known as the tallit
 , symbolizing the Hebrew people’s relationship with God. Observant Jews may also strap small black boxes to their arms and foreheads. These are called tefillin
 and contain scripture—including the Shema—written on parchment. To show respect, Jewish men cover their heads with a skullcap, the kippah
 or yarmulke
 , when studying scripture, eating, and praying at home or in the synagogue. Orthodox Jewish men also wear a yarmulke any time they are outside. In some traditional communities and synagogues, married Jewish women wear head coverings as well.
Kashrut
Jewish law includes dietary restrictions from the Torah about which foods may or may not be eaten and which foods must remain separate from each other. This code is called kashrut
 ; foods that meet these standards are kosher . These laws prohibit pork, shellfish, and mixing meat with dairy—for instance, meat and milk products may not be eaten or served at the same meal, and in some homes, separate kitchenware is used to prepare and serve them. Kosher laws are followed throughout the year by the most observant.
Brit Milah/Brit Bat
After birth, on the eighth day of a Jewish boy’s life, his parents hold a special circumcision ceremony called the brit milah
 , as commanded in Genesis 17:10. It is conducted by a trained circumciser (mohel
 ) and is a reminder of God’s covenant. Also on the eighth day, Jewish girls go through a naming ceremony called brit bat
 , a more recent custom not specified in the Torah.
Bar Mitzvah/Bat Mitzvah
A bar mitzvah
 (“son of the commandment”) is a coming-of-age ceremony that takes place on the first Sabbath after a Jewish boy’s thirteenth birthday, at which time he enters the adult Jewish community and becomes responsible for following Jewish law and traditions. The boy marks this occasion with a ceremony and celebration 
 that includes reading in Hebrew from the Torah. A similar ceremony for girls is called a bat mitzvah
 , which means “daughter of the commandment.”
Music/Chanting
In synagogues, chanted prayers are led by a cantor
 , or chazzan , often without music. The cantor may be a member of the congregation or a paid official.
Marriage Rituals
Jews view marriage as a relationship commanded by God for the purpose of procreation and companionship. Traditionally, the relationship begins with a formal betrothal, a status more binding than a typical engagement (breaking it requires divorce). During the wedding ceremony, the couple stands beneath a canopy known as a chuppah
 , which is stretched between four poles and symbolizes the home created by a husband and wife. A rabbi or family members then recite blessings over the couple.
Prohibitions and Sin
Breaking any one of the 613 commandments in the Torah is considered a sin. While all sins have consequences, some are less severe than others. While Jews believe that humans are imperfect and have a natural tendency to sin, they reject the more extreme Christian doctrine of original sin.
Repentance/Purification
At the Temple in Jerusalem, ancient Jews were required to make animal sacrifices, guided by priests, in atonement for their sins. Today, Jews repent their sins through prayer and obligatory acts of charity known as tzedakah
 . Orthodox Jews believe animal sacrifices will resume in Jerusalem upon the arrival of the Messiah.
DIVISIONS
Judaism has avoided splintering into thousands of denominations over the centuries. Considering all the hardships that have befallen them over that span of time, Jews have maintained a remarkable unity in their faith. The primary differences that exist in Judaism have to do with how strictly the Torah is obeyed and how fluidly one’s faith and culture blends with the modern world.
Orthodox Judaism
These Jews, many of whom live in Israel, emphasize preserving the rituals and traditions observed throughout the history of the faith. They believe the Torah is the word of God and should be obeyed to the letter as it relates to food, family, worship, and every aspect of life. Modern Orthodoxy allows room for synthesizing Jewish law with the modern world, but Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, Jews separate themselves from much of the modern world, wear distinctive dark clothing, and divide life into strict gender roles. These are the fundamentalists of Judaism.
Hasidic Judaism
A mystical segment of Orthodox Judaism, Hasidic Judaism arose as a reaction of the common people to a more scholarly approach to the Torah. Founded in the eighteenth century by Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, also known as Baal Shem Tov, Hasidism instructs Jews to cut themselves off from the modern world in order to pray, meditate, study the Torah, and focus on God. It notably features exuberant worship.
Reform Judaism
A radical movement that began in late eighteenth-century Europe, this branch of Judaism is the most open to interaction with modern society and stresses the need for the Jewish faith to evolve. Though they still value its authority, most Reform Jews believe in the human authorship—rather than divine authorship—of the Torah, and tend to emphasize its moral messages above its traditional rituals and practices. Reform Jews are far more likely than other denominations to intermarry with non-Jews. While Reform Judaism is very popular in North America, it has only a small presence in Israel.
Conservative Judaism
A bridge between Reform and Orthodox Judaism that developed in the nineteenth century, Conservative Judaism has flourished in Europe and the United States. Conservative Jews believe in the divine origin of the Torah and Talmud and honor traditional Jewish values, but with less separation from contemporary life than some Orthodox sects. Conservative Jews value history and its traditions, but believe religion must adjust in order to remain relevant.
Reconstructionist Judaism
This more liberal movement grew out of Conservative Judaism in the twentieth century and is often considered a fourth movement of Judaism in North America. Many of its adherents reject traditional theological claims, like belief in God, and are more interested in Judaism as a civilization.
Humanistic Judaism
Founded in the 1960s in the United States, this movement within Jewish culture is entirely nonreligious. It focuses on the ethnic culture of the Jewish people, including participation in traditional Jewish holidays and life events (like bar mitzvahs), but with rewritten liturgies that omit references to God.
Sephardic Judaism
During the Middle Ages, many Jews moved to Spain and Portugal, where they lived in peaceful proximity with Christians and Muslims, developing their own culture before being expelled in the late fifteenth century. These Mediterranean Jews are known as Sephardic Jews and maintain unique liturgies and traditions.
Ashkenazi Judaism
In contrast to the Sephardic Jews, Ashkenazi Jews began spreading into Europe in the centuries after Christianity began to dominate the Roman Empire. They settled in France and Germany before being pushed eastward during the Crusades. Before long, these Yiddish-speaking Jews had planted roots throughout Europe. Prior to being decimated by the Holocaust, they represented more than 90 percent of the Jews in the world. A majority of today’s Jews claim Ashkenazi heritage.
YIDDISH
What is Yiddish? This language was the historical tongue of the Ashkenazi Jews. It is written using the Hebrew alphabet, and is a blend of German, Hebrew, and traces of Slavic languages. While Jews today are most likely to speak the language of their country of origin, almost all Jews prior to World War II spoke Yiddish. Its use declined greatly due to the Holocaust, but many Yiddish words survive in modern English, including chutzpah
 (determination or audacity), futz
 (to fool around), klutz
 (a clumsy person), nosh
 (to snack or eat), schmooze
 (to chat, gossip, or attempt to impress), and schmuck
 (a jerk or fool).
INTO THE FUTURE
Though the Jews had been separated from their homeland for centuries, they began the twentieth century with a thriving culture, especially in Europe. Nearly 10 million Jews called the continent home. But between pogroms in Eastern Europe and Adolf Hitler’s rise to power, European Jews found themselves in grave danger. They had to hide their practices and beliefs, and flee to other nations, including the United States, Great Britain, and Canada. By the time World War II ended, six million Jews had lost their lives in the Holocaust—two out of every three in Europe—devastating the continent’s Jewish population. Persecuted and murdered for their faith and still without a homeland, Jews found themselves on the brink of extinction.
But the Jews survived. They carved out vibrant communities in the United States 
 and elsewhere. And since the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, millions of Jews have returned to their homeland to build what has become a prosperous, powerful nation.
No religion in the history of the world has proven as resilient as Judaism; but what about its future? Despite the hope brought by Israel, two trends worry Jewish leaders. One is assimilation. In Europe, large percentages of Jews are intermarrying with non-Jews, leaving their traditions behind as they adopt secular culture. Eight out of ten European Jews no longer attend synagogue, even on Yom Kippur. Another concern is isolation. The most devout Jews in Europe have immigrated to Israel. That trend will likely continue and the Jewish faith—though strong in its homeland—is slowly becoming more segregated from the rest of the world. Due to lower fertility rates and the same assimilation issues, the Jewish population is also declining in its other power center, the United States.
Christianity is flourishing in the Southern Hemisphere. Islam is growing in the Northern Hemisphere. Judaism is now concentrated in just a few communities worldwide—limiting the faith’s once-powerful influence on the global populace.CONFUCIANISM
Despite its inclusion in this book, Confucianism is not really a religion. Though Confucian temples exist throughout China and Chinese communities in other nations, they are dedicated to humans—not deities—and play a minor role in society. Confucianism lacks priests, liturgy, and theology. It ignores the idea of an afterlife in order to focus on human behavior in the here and now. Its sacred texts are dedicated not to transcendence but to mundane human activities like family relationships, etiquette, and government. Compared to most world religions, Confucianism is decidedly humanistic and mostly agnostic.
On the other hand, Confucianism has valued ritual ever since Confucius—the ancient scholar for whom Confucianism is named—first began teaching the cultivation of individual ethics to benefit society. He taught that these rituals and ethics were connected, especially those related to ancestor veneration. Confucianism’s offerings and burning of incense in memory of past generations may look very similar to other religious practices around the world, but the focus is very different. This centrality of ritual has led scholars to identify Confucianism not as a faith but rather as a religious system. This ancient system has shaped Chinese thought and culture for more than 2,500 years.
COMPASSION BENEFITS SOCIETY
Kong Fuzi—or Confucius, as he is called today in the West—was born in 551 BCE
 to commoners in Lu, a Chinese state now known as Shandong Province. The great teacher had a rough start to his life, as his father died when he was only three years old. His mother took on the task of educating him, and he showed an immense capacity for learning. He grew especially interested in history, the structures of government, and the social relationships between people.
As an adult, Confucius became an itinerant teacher around the time formal education was gaining prominence in China. He traveled from place to place, instructing the children of aristocratic families. Many of these young men became his disciples, following him as he formulated ideas about politics, education, and respect for fellow humans.

 The Five Classics and the Four Books
At the age of fifty, Confucius took a minor government position and became an administrator in his home state. While the region flourished under his guidance, legends indicate his rivals’ resistance to his moral rectitude drove him out of office. He returned to his teaching career and spent his final years advising government officials, passing along his wisdom to several dozen disciples, and writing down his teachings. Confucius died in the year 479 BCE
 . He was seventy-three years old and still relatively unknown.
But that anonymity didn’t last long. His students began composing commentaries on his teachings, which spread throughout China. At the time Confucius lived, Chinese beliefs were polytheistic and animistic. Each village worshipped its own local nature deity, making sacrifices in the hopes that good weather or health would result. Confucius had little interest in these gods or Chinese religion. Instead, he focused his philosophy on man’s innate goodness and the social cohesion that resulted when parents and children, husband and wife, older and younger people, and rulers and their subjects related to each other in the right way.
These ethical teachings had profound influence on Chinese society, and within a few centuries of Confucius’s death, they were viewed as supernatural in origin. Rituals were built upon his teachings, and Confucianism eventually became the dominant religious practice in China.
MAJOR FIGURES
The most important teachers and leaders in Confucian thought were its earliest philosophers, followed by Neo-Confucian scholars and prominent contemporary advocates.
Confucius
A sixth-century Chinese teacher and philosopher who lived from 551 to 479 BC, Confucius taught the importance of tradition, personal morality, and the value of harmonious relationships within five categories: parent and child, husband and wife, older sibling and younger sibling, ruler and subjects, and friend and friend. These relationships, he taught, should be marked by respect and a quality called ren
 —the humaneness and compassion that derives from love. While rituals were added to these ethical teachings in later centuries, these social and political relationships formed the original core of his philosophy.
Mencius
The best-known follower of Confucius’s teachings was Mencius. Said to have been a pupil of Confucius’s grandson Zisi in the fourth century BCE
 , Mencius amplified Confucius’s philosophy. He taught that human nature, or xing
 , was innately good, and encouraged the government to treat common people with benevolence. To some historians, this made Mencius an early advocate for a type of democracy. His influence was so great that most Chinese people view him as the cofounder of Confucianism.
Xunzi
Xun Kuang—commonly referred to as Xunzi (“Master Xun”)—was a Confucian philosopher during the third century BCE
 . His teachings, compiled in a book called Xunzi
 , helped guide the laws and social order of the Han dynasty, but took a more negative view of humanity than those of Mencius. Xunzi argued that most people had naturally destructive, evil tendencies and required religious ritual in order to defeat selfishness and cultivate goodness. Despite contradicting Mencius’s highly influential perspective, Xunzi’s intellectual approach helped structure Confucian ethics, positioning it to dominate Chinese thought over the next few centuries.
Dong Zhongshu
A scholar in the second century BCE
 , Dong Zhongshu was instrumental in the Chinese imperial state’s adoption of Confucianism as its official ideological position—a governmental philosophy that lasted for the next two millennia. Dong served as a chief advisor for Emperor Wu during the Han dynasty, helping convince the emperor to endorse the ideals of Confucianism over those of Taoism. His work laid the foundation for a civil-service system that required expertise in Confucianism of all government officials.
Zhu Xi
A twelfth-century Confucian scholar, Zhu Xi is considered by some to be China’s second-most 
 important philosopher, next to Confucius. Zhu Xi helped codify the Confucian canon (the Four Books, or Sishu;
 see here
 ), ensuring that they would be the foundational Chinese civil-service texts, at least until the twentieth century. In agreement with Mencius about the innate goodness of humankind, his teachings became central to the Neo-Confucian revival movement, which restored Confucian ideas to prominence and challenged the prevalence of Taoism and Buddhism.
CONFUCIUS? NOT REALLY
 If you lived in ancient China, you’d never hear the name “Confucius.” This name is a Westernized version of one of the teacher’s titles, Kong Fuzi, meaning “Master Kong.” The name “Confucius” likely originated with the earliest Christian missionaries to China in the sixteenth century (including the Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci), who attempted to Latinize “Kong Fuzi.” The teacher’s given name was Kong Qiu, and today, most people in China refer to him as Kongzi.
Wang Yangming
A Chinese scholar in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, Wang Yangming was the fourth-most influential sage after Confucius, Mencius, and Zhu Xi. Though he studied both Taoism and Buddhism, he eventually turned away from those philosophies due to the ethereality and impracticality of their teachings. Wang criticized Zhu Xi’s rationality, but taught that all humans intuitively know the difference between good and evil from birth. He insisted that knowledge and action are closely related and that social problems begin when people fail to live up to their potential.
Hu Jintao
The President of the People’s Republic of China from 2003 to 2013, Hu Jintao began reintroducing Confucian values to China nearly a century after their suppression due to Chinese political upheaval. Though Jintao is not personally a strict adherent of Confucianism, his promotion of Confucius’s teachings about a stable, harmonious society led to a nationwide revival of interest in the ancient philosophy.
Jiang Qing
A contemporary author widely known as the most prominent contemporary Chinese Confucian, Qing champions an ideology he calls “Political Confucianism,” advocating it as a ruling theory more suited to modern China than Western forms of democracy are. The founder of the Confucian-based Yangming Academy, Qing has argued against Neo-Confucianism’s individual approach to solving social and political issues, as well as against the blending of Western ideas with Chinese culture.
MAJOR TENETS
Confucianism is primarily a philosophy that eventually became associated with elements commonly thought of as religious. Its most significant emphasis is harmony within human relationships.
Creation
Confucianists believe the heavenly tian—a vaguely defined concept like the Tao—is the ultimate source of the world and the humans who live in it, and that the interaction between yin and yang sustains the world. Otherwise, it lacks a distinct creation myth. If Confucians have any beliefs about the origins of the world, they’re likely to come from Buddhism or ancient Chinese mythology.
Tian
Tian
 is the highest will of heaven, an absolute power similar to that of the unchanging Tao (see here
 ). Tian has been thought of in a number of ways: as the sky, as the conditions of nature, as the elements of fate outside human control. Chinese folk religion prior to Confucianism associated tian with an impersonal heavenly deity as well as the spiritual realm of departed ancestors. While Confucianism lacks any deities, the concept of tian comes close to being its most traditionally religious or transcendent element. Confucius taught that tian both aligned with and depended upon human morality.
Ren and Li
The outward, social expression of the loving ideals of Confucianism, ren
 can be defined as “goodness,” “benevolence,” or “humaneness.” Every human is capable of ren. It’s the virtue one exhibits when feeling or displaying compassion toward another, and it characterizes the ideal human behavior required for a successful community.
The companion concept to ren, li
 refers to the rules and human relationships that embody the expression of ren. Li consists of proper actions, decorum, and the relationships of a well-ordered society. While it originally referred to religious rituals, teachers like Confucius and Xunzi identified everything from tea drinking to the wearing of ceremonial robes as elements of li.
THE SUPERIOR MAN
 Confucius and Mencius both taught that virtue could be cultivated and that their disciples should strive to become junzi
 , or “superior men.” Second only to a sage in terms of morality, the junzi always behaved properly and fulfilled his role in the society. The “superior man” is the subject of many well-known statements by Confucius.
Sacred Texts
The Five Classics are the primary texts of Confucianism and are believed to have been edited by Confucius. These writings predate Confucius and represent the oldest literature in China. Until the early twentieth century, an understanding of these books was required for Chinese civil-service exams. Writings attributed to Confucius and Confucian scholars are known as the Four Books; these were the primary introduction to Confucian thought, as fixed by Zhu Xi in the twelfth century.
Five Relationships
According to Confucius, a harmonious and stable society came from individuals knowing their roles in five types of relationships: parent and child, husband and wife, older sibling and younger sibling, ruler and ruled, and friend and friend. While a friendship may have been a relationship between equals, the rest included a superior or elder partner (for example, a parent or husband) and a junior partner (a child or wife). Each member of the relationship was responsible for showing the proper amount of love to the junior member and respect to the senior member (see sidebar below). This veneration of elders extended beyond death into rituals of ancestor worship.
THE FIVE RELATIONSHIPS
Within Confucius’s Five Relationships, the senior member of the pair was expected to show ren
 (humanity or compassion) while the junior member would display the appropriate form of respect.
Ruler and ruled:
 The emperor would be kind to his subjects; his subjects would show him loyalty.
Parent and child:
 A father and mother would love their children; the children would be obedient.
Husband and wife:
 A husband would be fair to his wife; she would be reverential toward him.
Siblings:
 The older sibling would be considerate of the younger sibling; the younger sibling would be deferential to the older one. (This was presented in male terms: brother to brother.)
Friends:
 While friends were largely considered equals, the younger of the two would be expected to show the older one respect.
Heavenly Mandate (Tianming)
Tianming
 was the belief that the behavior of China’s ruler—good or bad—could influence the prosperity and health of the country. The tian was thought to rule through the emperor, also known as the “Son of Heaven.” If he showed proper reverence to his ancestors and other moral qualities, these virtues would be reflected in the society around him and the people would obey his laws. This harmony would ensure the blessings of rain and good harvests from tian. But unrighteous rulers could lose the heavenly mandate by improper or unloving behavior, which legitimized rebellion. Natural disasters were also considered a sign that a ruler had lost the heavenly mandate.
Ancestor Worship
Because the parent-child relationship was viewed as so central to society, ancestor worship became embedded in Confucianism. Most of its ritualistic elements are related to this practice. Though many non-Confucians mistake the phrase “ancestor worship” to imply the same kind of adoration they might show to the Christian God or Allah, the practice is more akin to a reverence for one’s parents that does not end at death. Performing correct rites in their honor—for instance, in marriage ceremonies, during funerals, and by leaving offerings to them at household shrines—helps perpetuate a harmonious relationship between heaven and earth.
Ethics/Morality
For Confucians, the most meaningful and righteous life involves fulfilling social obligations, showing the proper respect to one’s ancestors, and perfecting virtue by developing one’s innate goodness.
The Soul
While popular Chinese religion viewed individuals as possessing both a spiritual soul (hun
 ) and a physical soul (po
 ), which separated at the time of death, Confucius exhibited skepticism about this concept.
Salvation
Confucianism lacks any teachings about individual salvation. Confucius taught that personal virtue should be cultivated out of respect for others and the good of society rather than for eternal reward.
The Afterlife and End of Time
From a metaphysical standpoint, Confucius ignored the idea of an afterlife. In his teachings, the sage usually deflected questions about what happened after death in order to teach about the proper way to live. He taught that personal virtue should be cultivated out of respect for others and the good of society rather than for eternal reward. The veneration of ancestors is the closest element to an afterlife in Confucian teachings.
The Confucian Book of Ritual
 teaches that the end of human destiny is a utopian ideal called Da Tong
 (“the Great Unity”) in which all people live in harmony, care for one another, and maintain their responsibilities in a perfectly stable society. Otherwise, Confucianism has little to say about eschatology, or the end of history.
MAJOR TEXTS
Unique among world religions, some of Confucianism’s most important texts actually predate the life of its founder. Its canonical “scriptures” are divided into the Five Classics and the Four Books
The Five Classics
The Five Classics are the ancient sources from which Confucius began to develop his ideas.
1.Book of Poetry
 (Shijing
 ): More than 300 love songs, mythic poems, and hymns about the ancient rulers of China, from the tenth century to the seventh century BCE
2.Book of History (Shujing) : Speeches and documents related to, among other things, the Zhou dynasty and its most famous figures, some of which may date as far back as the eleventh century BCE
3.Book of Ritual (Liji)
 : A compilation of rules related to proper social etiquette, court ceremonies, and other ancient rites. Confucius is believed to have edited the original text.
4.Annals of Spring and Autumn (Chunqiu)
 : An official history of the Chinese state of Lu, from 722 to 481 BCE
 , containing short entries on marriages, deaths, battles, natural disasters, and more. At the time of its writing, the phrase “spring and autumn” had come to mean “year.”
5.Book of Changes (I Ching)
 : A widely used divination manual based on hexagrams.
THE I CHING
One of the Five Classics, the I Ching
 originated as a divination manual that may date back as far as the tenth century BCE. This ancient text features sixty-four symbolic, six-lined figures called hexagrams that operate on the principles of yin and yang. Interpreted by casting lots, the divided lines (yin
 ) and undivided lines (yang
 ) of each hexagram were believed to predict the future and inspire morality. Along with the hexagrams, the I Ching
 included several commentaries, some of which were attributed to Confucius.
The Four Books
The Four Books are works written by Confucius and his followers, and make up the core teachings of his philosophy.
1.Analects
 (Lunyu
 ): A collection of sayings by Confucius and his disciples, and one of the most influential books in Chinese history. Historians consider this work the most reliable source of Confucius’s teachings
2.Doctrine of the Mean (Zhongyong):
 A chapter in the Book of Ritual (Liji)
 attributed to Confucius’s grandson Zisi. It teaches a central Confucian doctrine about maintaining an unchanging equilibrium in the pursuit of one’s duty within the natural order.
3.Great Learning (Daxue):
 A fifth-century BCE
 educational text about learning and self-cultivation, allegedly written by Confucius, then followed by the commentary of a younger disciple named Zengzi. Like the Doctrine of the Mean,
 it originated as a chapter in the Book of Ritual (Liji)
4.Mencius (Mengzi)
 : A compilation of Mencius’s anecdotes, explanations, and dialogues. Many of his arguments take the form of advice to rulers.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
Primarily an ethical system, Confucianism has no liturgical practices and only a few “religious” rituals—all associated with life stages, families, and ancestor veneration.
Leaders
With few true religious practices, Confucianism lacks a priesthood or monastic tradition. Instead, scholars, sages, and teachers are highly honored. On special occasions in state temples, ritual specialists may lead ceremonies.
Temples
Confucian temples are not major parts of its religious or ritual practice, but they do exist in large cities as well as towns related to the lineage of Confucius. The most prominent is the large Temple of Confucius at Qufu, the hometown of the sage. At this temple and others, visitors make offerings of incense, food, or drink to Confucius and other great scholars, often asking for a blessing as they do so. Every year, on Confucius’s birthday, a “grand sacrifice” (tai-lao
 ) of animals is made at Confucian temples, along with ritual dances and other performances.
TO BE CONFUCIANIST
 “What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.” —Confucius
Ancestral Shrines
Known as the tsu-miao
 , this family shrine is a room at home with an altar or shelf that contains photos of deceased family members, incense burners, and an ancestral tablet bearing the names of the departed. Family members might offer sacrifices of food or drink on special days or burn incense as a gesture of reverence. This home temple is the center of Confucian ritual within the family.
Ancestral Tablets
This elongated wooden tablet, called shenwei
 , shows the ancestry line of deceased 
 family members. These tablets may be as large as three feet tall and are placed on a family’s household shrine and occasionally at a burial site. Instead of a tablet, some homes display a framed red piece of paper depicting the names of deceased parents and grandparents—usually no further back than three generations.
Confucian temples also include ancestral tablets honoring Confucius and other teachers. Originally, portraits or statues called hsiang
 were placed in temple altars, but they were eventually replaced by tablets to differentiate the custom from Buddhism.
A SAMPLE TEACHING OF CONFUCIUS
 “Let the lord be a true lord, the ministers true ministers, the fathers true fathers, and the sons true sons.”
—Analects
 12.11
Birth
Because descendants are so prized among Confucians, birth is considered a significant life passage, and pregnant women are highly valued. The spirit of a fetus, known as tai-shen
 , is thought to protect the expectant mother throughout her pregnancy and delivery.
Capping/Pinning Ceremony
This coming-of-age ritual, known as guan li
 for men and ji li for women, is related to how young men and women wear their hair to symbolize their entrance into adulthood. At the age of twenty, a male pulls his hair into a bun and covers it with a cap. At sixteen, a young woman pins her hair by gathering it into a knot and securing it with a hairpin. During these ceremonies, people of both genders receive a new “adult” name. The capping/pinning ceremonies symbolize readiness for marriage and are considered important milestones in the continuance of the family.
Marriage Rituals
Confucian weddings are considered foundational to individual ethics and to the overall stability of a society. In the past, they followed a succession of formal rituals (known as hun li
 ) between the bride and groom. These included initial contact between families during the betrothal process, the giving of special gifts upon acceptance of betrothal, wedding dates chosen via divination, special dowry gifts, and elaborate processions from the home of the bride to the groom’s house. After the wedding night, the groom formally presents the bride to her new in-laws and to the ancestral shrine.
Mourning
Proper burial practices are major obligations within Confucianism, which at various times has required a multimonth mourning period during which the deceased is believed to transition into the role of an ancestor. During this time, those in mourning were expected to wear special garments, eat simple foods, abstain from 
 wine, and even avoid sexual relations. Because parents physically carried their children for up to three years, Confucius taught that this mourning period should last for three years.
Funeral Rites
After the end of the mourning period, the ancestor’s name is carved or written onto the ancestral tablet, thus establishing a place in the ancestral shrine. Portraits of the deceased are added to the shrine. Upon visiting either the shrine or tomb, visitors bow or kneel in front of the tablet and portrait. Members of the family are then expected to monitor the burial site, visit the shrine often, and even update the ancestor on family news. On Tomb-Sweeping Day in April, family members clean tombs, remove weeds, and tend to the soil of the gravesite. To show respect, they leave behind offerings of food and wine and burn incense.
Meditation
Because Confucius advocated action more than reflection, the concept of meditation did not enter Confucian practice until Zhu Xi and the Neo-Confucian revival movement of the twelfth century. At this time, the teachings of Taoism and Buddhism brought a more metaphysical approach to Confucianism. The Neo-Confucians taught jing zuo
 , or “quiet sitting,” in order to reach a state of calmness. This state was considered important to gaining wisdom and developing virtue.
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
The observance of Confucius’s birthday occurs on the twenty-seventh day of the eighth month of the Chinese calendar, which is based on the phases of the moon. In Taiwan, this observance takes place on September 28, “Teachers’ Day”; in China, however, “Teachers’ Day” is celebrated two weeks earlier.
With regard to other festivals and holy days, Confucianism largely observes the same ones as Taoism (see here
 ). The Confucian emphasis on ancestor worship also makes Tomb-Sweeping Day (Qingming) a significant festival. Major observances take place throughout China, especially at the Temple of Confucius in Qufu, Shandong Province, near where Confucius was born and buried. Observances include music, dancing, calligraphy demonstrations, sacrifices, and other ceremonies.
KINDNESS OR MISTREATMENT
Confucianism promotes respect, humility, and benevolence in all social interactions between humans. Children are taught to value their parents’ wisdom, and parents are taught to show kindness to their children. Siblings defer to one another with humility. Employers and employees treat each other with respect and politeness. Even rulers were taught to act with humanity or expect rebellion. Individuals are required to put forth their best effort, be attentive to their responsibilities, and always display proper behavior. Many of Confucius’s teachings fit within the message of the Golden Rule as found in many world religions: Treat others like you want to be treated
 . In an ideal world, a society characterized by Confucian ethics would be exceptionally harmonious.
On the other hand, humans, of course, do not always live in an ideal world or perform according to expectations, which means treatment on the basis of a person’s title or social position can have negative consequences. An authoritarian regime can easily take advantage of an obedient population. Abuse might be ignored because children are expected to respect their parents. Sexism—though it complied with ancient Chinese culture—was a cornerstone of Confucianism. A young girl would have been expected to submit to the authority of her father or even an older brother. As an adult, she would have been subservient to her husband’s loving authority. In the case of a husband’s early death, a widow would be required to respect and obey her eldest son.
DIVISIONS
Because Confucianism is not a religion with a centralized orthodoxy, its historical divisions were based on governmental changes and shifts in philosophy after Confucius’s death. The teachings of Mencius, who believed humans were intrinsically good and that our intuitive morality should guide our activity, have been the most lasting and popular approach, and they still predominate Confucianism today. A few other schools of Confucianism include the following.
Xunzi Confucianism
Xunzi (Xun Kuang) opposed Mencius’s teachings and taught that humans were evil by nature. He believed this nature could be limited through strict adherence to ethical codes, and that virtue could be attained after great effort and education. He also taught that rituals and music were necessary to limit a disordered society.
Neo-Confucianism
Neo-Confucianism was a renaissance of Confucian thought that emerged in the ninth century and flourished in the twelfth century under the influence of Zhu Xi. Due to the influence of Taoism and Buddhism, Neo-Confucianism took a much more metaphysical worldview, emphasizing the spiritual, interior realm as essential to fostering harmony in the social sphere. This revival split into two different schools of thought that 
 disagreed on the understanding of whether li
 —the ritual or law—was an unchanging, external force like the Tao or an inner principle found within oneself through meditation.
New/Modern Confucianism
Associated with Neo-Confucianism, this movement surfaced in the early twentieth century as an attempt to harmonize the social and political principles of Confucian thought with Western secularism. Part intellectual movement and part political ideology, it posits that Confucianism is the highest expression of Chinese culture and wisdom and should not be lost as China opens to the outside world. This school argues for a more democratic China, but one in which the government still rules humanely, the people can still rebel if necessary, and hierarchical relationships still promote harmony.
INTO THE FUTURE
The Chinese government today recognizes five official religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Roman Catholicism, Protestant Christianity, and Islam. Confucianism is not one of those religions. Though it was once the state religion and even formed the basis of government, the rise of twentieth-century communism suppressed its practice. Knowledge of Confucian teachings is no longer required of political employees, and its texts are no longer the central lessons at schools. Few Chinese identify themselves as Confucian. Because China’s religions are not exclusive, a typical citizen might practice elements of Confucian ancestor worship, seek harmony with the Tao, and rely on Buddhist burial practices without giving a second thought to the difference between these religions.
But the social values taught by Confucius are everywhere in contemporary Chinese life and have reemerged especially strongly as capitalism has entered China in recent years. Confucian ideals are visible in every interaction between parent and child, boss and employee, business colleague and business colleague. Confucius’s reverence for tradition and learning remain central to Chinese culture, and his focus on individual respect in social interactions has simply become a way of life. Few people may practice Confucianism exclusively, but a majority of China’s population follows its commonsense teachings and ethical rules—whether they know it or not. Confucius remains perhaps the greatest teacher in China’s long history of philosophy. While specific rituals or traditions may diminish, Chinese life is shaped by Confucianism. That is not likely to change.BAHÁ’Í
Even the oldest and most enduring world religions were once innovative and new, many of them developing as offshoots of other religions. The same is true for the Bahá’í Faith, which is less than two centuries old. Beginning as a heretical offshoot of Shia Islam, it is one of the most widespread and fastest-growing religions today. This global movement now has an established presence in almost every nation on earth, with prominent houses of worship in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Its sacred writings have been translated into hundreds of languages. Its shrines attract hundreds of thousands of pilgrims annually.
Why has the Bahá’í Faith shown growth unlike any other religious movement on earth? A likely explanation begins with its doctrines, which are unique among the world’s belief systems. Bahá’í teachings focus on worldwide peace and unity. Its leaders recognize that some of humanity’s deepest prejudices come from its religious differences. For that reason, the official Bahá’í stance toward other religions is one of tolerance and appreciation. It respects all religious prophets as divine messengers in an ongoing revelation of God. Bahá’í believers work to eliminate economic injustice, reduce racial and ethnic bigotry, and promote gender equality wherever possible.
Yet the pursuit of these lofty goals takes place without priests or sacraments. Instead, it holds its members to a high level of personal morality and community involvement. This dynamic world religion has a distinct and contemporary message.
THE GATE AND THE GLORY
For centuries, Muslims had been waiting for the return of the Mahdi, a messianic figure who would bring peace, justice, and the message of Islam to the entire world. In 1844, a twenty-four-year-old Persian merchant named Ali-Muhammad declared he was that long-awaited redeemer, calling himself the “Gate”—or, in Arabic, the Bab
 . He gathered many followers who called themselves Babis
 , but his teachings set him in opposition to the Islamic clergy and government. Eventually, these followers fell victim to persecution. As many as three thousand died in the years after his proclamation. Iran executed the Bab by firing squad in 1850. He was thirty years old.
Before his death, the Bab predicted Allah would send another messenger in his place. In the years after the Bab’s execution, more than two dozen men claimed to be that promised messenger. Meanwhile, the Bab’s followers continued to be persecuted and imprisoned. The most successful claimant was a Babi named Husayn-Ali. In 1852, while imprisoned in the Siyah Chal, Tehran’s famed underground dungeon, Ali claimed to have received a revelation that he was Allah’s prophesied messenger. After being exiled to Baghdad and then Constantinople along with other Babis, he gave himself the title Bahá’u’lláh
 , which means “the glory of God,” in 1863. His followers began calling themselves Bahá’í, or the “followers of glory.”

 Kitab-i-Aqdas
Eventually, the Islamic-led Ottoman Empire banished Bahá’u’lláh to a penal colony in Akka, Palestine (now Acre, Israel), where he spent the rest of his life writing and teaching. Rejecting the claims of orthodox Islam, he taught that God had sent a succession of messengers—including Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad—to establish religions that were appropriate to the time and place they began. Each religion and its scriptures offered an element of truth and built upon previous revelations. Bahá’u’lláh was the newest prophet of God, he explained, and others would come after him as God’s message continued to unfold. God’s ultimate message to the world was not religious conflict but global unity and peace.
Before his death in 1892, Bahá’u’lláh appointed his eldest son, ’Abdu’l-Bahá, as his successor and the primary interpreter of his writings. After obtaining freedom from exile in 1908, ’Abdu’l-Bahá began traveling the world and spreading his father’s message
MAJOR FIGURES
As a relatively young world religion, the Bahá’í Faith has a short list of historical leaders. It includes the two messengers of the faith—the Bab and Bahá’u’lláh—along with the two men named as their immediate successors and guardians of the faith.
The Bab
In 1844, Ali-Muhammad claimed to be the Mahdi, or “Hidden Imam”—a messianic figure in Shia Islam—and began calling himself the Bab, or “Gate.” His religious movement, Babism, amassed thousands of followers in Iran, but the Islamic government violently opposed it, persecuting and killing thousands of Babists. Ali-Muhammad was executed by firing squad in 1850 for heresy against Islam. Before his death, he referred to a coming divine figure known as “He whom God shall make manifest.”
Bahá’u’lláh
Husayn-Ali was a follower of the Bab who experienced a revelation in 1852 that he was the divine messenger prophesied by the Bab. Despite living in exile, he declared himself Bahá’u’lláh (“glory of God”) in 1863. He and his followers, who called themselves Bahá’í, were imprisoned by the Ottoman Empire and banished to Akka, Palestine, where Bahá’u’lláh began writing and teaching the tenets of the Bahá’í Faith. He died in 1892 after naming his son, ’Abdu’l-Bahá, as his successor.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá
The head of the Bahá’í Faith from 1892 to 1921, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (birth name: Abbas Effendi) was Bahá’u’lláh’s son. He directed the construction of the first Bahá’í House of Worship in Turkmenistan and the Shrine of the Bab in Haifa (where the Bab was buried). He also 
 had the House of the Bab restored in Shiraz, Iran, all while still exiled with his family in Akka. After the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, he departed Akka to travel the world and promoted the Bahá’í message. He sailed to North America in 1912, declining an offer to board the maiden voyage of the Titanic
 , and died in 1920 after naming his grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as his successor.
Shoghi Effendi
Shoghi Effendi was the great-grandson of Bahá’u’lláh and guardian of the Bahá’í Faith from 1921 until 1957. During his leadership, the faith quadrupled in size as Effendi established Spiritual Assemblies to guide the faith in other countries. He also began translating many of the works of the Bab, Bahá’u’lláh, and ’Abdu’l-Bahá into English. In 1953, he instituted the Ten-Year World Crusade, a plan to consolidate the faith and expand it worldwide, establishing the Universal House of Justice to become its central administrative arm. Shoghi Effendi died in 1957, and Bahá’í leadership passed on to the elected members of the Universal House of Justice.
THE GREATEST NAME
The Quran teaches that Allah has ninety-nine beautiful names. The Bahá’í Faith, rooted in Islam, teaches that Baha
 (“glory”) is the special one-hundredth hidden name of God. They call this the Greatest Name, and use an Arabic calligraphic depiction of the word Baha
 to represent Bahá’u’lláh, any Messenger of God, or the faith itself. This pictograph often appears in Houses of Worship or Bahá’í devotional materials. (A common misperception among English-speaking outsiders is that it spells the word Evil
 in English.)
MAJOR TENETS
The Bahá’í Faith grew out of Shia Islam, and its tenets share a few characteristics with Islam. However, today’s Bahá’í Faith is very much a monotheistic world religion with its own distinct beliefs.
Creation
Like the Creator, the universe is eternal and has no beginning or end. The beauty and diversity of the natural world is an expression of the Creator’s attributes, and knowledge of God can be gained by studying the created world. Humans are not to worship nature; however, as stewards of the earth, they should maintain respect for the environment and take care with natural resources.
Deity
God is the supreme, transcendent creator of the universe and is all-knowing and all-loving. Different religions identify God by different names because the human mind is limited—especially by culture—and cannot fully comprehend deity. For this reason, God uses progressive revelation to teach religious truth to humanity. He reveals these truths through a series of messengers whose teachings are appropriate to a certain time, place, and level of human understanding.
Messengers
God intervenes in human history through prophets or divine messengers who are each considered manifestations of God. These include Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus Christ, Muhammad, the Bab, and Bahá’u’lláh. These messengers provide a level of spiritual guidance that can be understood at the time of their appearance and are often followed by a period of extraordinary human progress.
Scriptures
The writings of the Bab and Bahá’u’lláh are considered divine revelations, and the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi are authoritative interpretations of that revelation. Of the thousands of collected writings of Bahá’u’lláh, the Kitab-i-Aqdas holds particular importance. It is the primary scripture of the Bahá’í Faith. However, the faith teaches that all the world’s holy texts should be respected, including the revelations of God in the Bible and the Quran.
Humanity
All humans have an eternal soul and are equal in the sight of God regardless of gender, race, or social class. Therefore, the unity of humanity should be pursued above all else while still celebrating and maintaining its diversity. Servants of God should oppose inequality and prejudice in all forms.
Prohibitions and Permissions
Individual Bahá’ís are to avoid alcohol, tobacco, and mind-altering drugs. Gossip and speaking ill of others are considered especially harmful behaviors. Sexual relationships outside marriage are prohibited. However, interfaith marriages are permitted and interracial marriages are encouraged. Working for the overall good of society is emphasized, but it must promote the unity of humankind. Therefore, Bahá’í teachings forbid the practice of partisan politics.
Worship
Congregational worship plays only a small role in the Bahá’í Faith. If Bahá’í adherents meet in community, it is usually in informal home prayer gatherings or at monthly “feasts” to build unity and fellowship. While food is not always central to these feasts—they mostly revolve around prayer, scripture readings, and administrative discussions—a community meal is sometimes served. These gatherings are known as Nineteen-Day Feasts
 because they occur at that frequency according to the Bahá’í calendar.
TO BE BAHÁ’Í
 “All peoples and nations are of one family, the children of one Father, and should be to one another as brothers and sisters.” —Bahá’u’lláh
The Soul
The human soul exists at the moment of conception—considered the beginning of human life—but in a separate form from the physical embryo. It represents a person’s most essential identity, including the individual’s thoughts, understanding, and imagination. The soul is also immortal and, after death, will continue toward unity with God.
Salvation
Salvation is not a singular event, a liberation from sin, or the achievement of a state of transcendence. Instead, it is a process by which an individual draws closer to God. Men and women cannot achieve personal salvation on their own; they must rely upon and recognize the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh as a type of mediator between humanity and God. Together, the Bahá’í community also works to bring about a more universal salvation for humankind through the pursuit of unity and peace.
Funeral Rites
If possible, Bahá’í bury their dead less than an hour’s journey from the place where the individual died, with feet pointed toward the Qiblih, where Bahá’u’lláh is buried. Attendees at a Bahá’í funeral must together recite the Prayer for the Dead, the Bahá’í Faith’s only obligatory congregational prayer.
Death and the Afterlife
Bahá’í beliefs about an afterlife are not well defined, and its founders did not teach the existence of heaven or hell. Though these doctrines appear in the scriptures of other religions, they should be understood symbolically. The Bahá’í do believe in the eternity of the soul after death, and that the disembodied soul continues along a path toward joy, perfection, and unity with God. The next life will be as different from one’s present life as this world is for a child emerging from a mother’s womb.
THE NINE-POINTED STAR
In designing the House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois, Bahá’í architect Louis Bourgeois developed a symmetrical nine-pointed star to represent the faith. The symbol was approved by Shoghi Effendi for use on gravestone markers in 1944 to indicate the faith tradition of deceased Bahá’ís. It has since become a pictograph that represents the faith.
Traditionally, the number nine has been significant throughout Bahá’í history. In the Arabic abjad numeral system, the word baha
 (“glory”) has a numerical value of nine. As the single digit with the highest value in the decimal number system, nine symbolized perfection to early Bahá’ís.
Dedicated in 1953, the twenty-story-high Wilmette House of Worship is now the oldest in the faith. It has nine entrances, nine alcoves, nine pillars, and nine fountains across the temple’s grounds.
MAJOR TEXTS
In addition to valuing the sacred texts of other religions—including those of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity—the Bahá’í Faith views the writings of the Bab and Bahá’u’lláh as divine revelations from God. Thousands of these writings exist across hundreds of volumes.
Qayyum al-Asma
The first theological work written after the Bab’s 1844 declaration, the Qayyum al-Asma
 , which means “The Enduring of Names,” is considered the equivalent of the Quran for the Bab’s followers. Written by the Bab in Arabic, it parallels the Quran in structure.
The Persian Bayán
A nineteen-chapter document written by the Bab in Persian in 1847, the Persian Bayán
 is the Bab’s most complete legal, social, and theological work. In addition to identifying himself as the messianic Twelfth Imam (Mahdi), he reveals new teachings separate from Islam and frequently mentions “He whom God shall make manifest,” a coming prophet. The book remained unfinished at the time of the Bab’s death. The title Bayán
 means “expression.” A condensed version, written in Arabic, is known as the Arabic Bayán
Kitab-i-Asma
This 3,000-page text was written by the Bab in Arabic between 1847 and 1850. Across 361 chapters, it explains and discusses the various names of God through written prayers and commentaries. The title means “Book of Divine Names.”
Dala’il-i-Sab’ih
The title of this work in English is “The Seven Proofs.” It sets forth seven arguments defending the Bab’s divine claims and the truth of his writing.
Kitab-i-Aqdas
The central sacred book of the Bahá’í Faith, often referred to as “the Mother Book,” Kitabi-Aqdas contains 189 poetic paragraphs; it details worship practices, social principles, prophecies, ethics, administrative laws, and other spiritual themes. It was composed by Bahá’u’lláh in Arabic in 1873, and the title means “Most Holy Book.”
Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
This collection of previously unpublished writings from Bahá’u’lláh, written between 1853 and 1892, was compiled and translated by Shoghi Effendi. It includes teachings on the manifestations of God, the soul, the centrality of unity, and the meaning of life. Published in 
 dozens of languages, it serves as many people’s introduction to the Bahá’í Faith.
Chahar Vadi
Written in 1857 for a Sufi leader, this book describes the four types of “mystic wayfarers.” The title means “The Four Valleys,” and though unrelated to Haft-Vadi
 (“The Seven Valleys”), it is often published alongside it.
Haft-Vadi
A poetic, mystical work by Bahá’u’lláh, Haft-Vadi
 was written in 1860 in response to questions asked by a Sufi judge. The title means “The Seven Valleys” and refers to the seven stages of the soul’s spiritual journey.
QIBLIH
 The Qiblih is the shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, located near Acre, Israel. It is the focal point for obligatory Bahá’í prayers.
Kitab-i-Iqan
The Kitab-i-Iqan
 , or “Book of Certitude,” is a 200-page treatise written by Bahá’u’lláh in 1861 and 1862, responding to questions from a relative of the Bab. It offers proofs of the Bab’s divine message and quotes both the Bible and the Quran to support the validity of the Bab’s claims.
Kalimat-i-Maknunih
Kalimat-i-Maknunih
 , meaning “hidden words,” is a book of aphorisms, spiritual truths, and divine mysteries by Bahá’u’lláh, written in both Arabic and Persian.
Lawh-i-Ibn-i-Dhib
The last major text of Bahá’u’lláh, written a year before his death to the powerful Muslim cleric Aqa Najafi, the Lawh-i-Ibn-i-Dhib
 summarizes most of Bahá’u’lláh’s previous work. The title means “Epistle to the Son of the Wolf.”
Kitab-i-Ahd
The Kitab-i-Ahd
 , or “Book of the Covenant,” is the last will and testament of Bahá’u’lláh, written in Arabic. In it, he names ’Abdu’l-Bahá as his successor.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
The Bahá’í Faith promotes a distinct lack of ritual. There are no clergy, initiation ceremonies, or liturgies. Its gatherings often take place in homes and are very informal. What ritual practices it does encourage have origins in Islam, including prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage.
Worship Through Work
Every individual should seek to perform honest work, a trade, or a profession to the best of his or her abilities and for the good of society. Work performed in this spirit of service to humankind is considered a form of worship equivalent to prayer.
Devotional Prayer
Bahá’ís believe prayer is a natural impulse and are expected to pray on a regular basis. The purpose of prayer is to improve devotion or request assistance from God. In addition to praying in their own words, they may use prayers written by the Bab, Bahá’u’lláh, or other spiritual leaders. In many Bahá’í meetings, participants may take turns reading from a prayer book.
Obligatory Prayer
The daily recitation of required prayers is one of the central acts of individual piety. Beginning at the age of fifteen, every Bahá’í should say one of three prayers every day while facing the Qiblih, or shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Written by Bahá’u’lláh, these are known as the short prayer
 (a few sentences long), the medium prayer
 (four paragraphs), and the long prayer
 (more than 1,500 words in length).
A Bahá’í may choose any of these three prayers but must follow the required times and directions associated with each. The short prayer must be said between noon and sunset. The medium prayer must occur three times daily: in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. The long prayer may be recited at any time but only once every twenty-four hours. The medium and long prayers involve obligatory movements like standing, kneeling, bowing, and raising the hands. A ritual cleansing of the hands and face precedes all prayers.
COMMON PRAYER: BEARING WITNESS
A Bahá’í adherent is required to recite a daily prayer or prayers. According to the teachings of Shoghi Effendi, the believer has the option of reciting a short, medium, or long version of this obligatory prayer. Below is the shortest option, an English translation of a prayer originally written by Bahá’u’lláh:
I bear witness, O my God, that Thou hast created me to know Thee and to worship Thee. I testify, at this moment, to my powerlessness and to Thy might, to my poverty and to Thy wealth. There is none other God but Thee, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting
Meditation
Bahá’u’lláh taught that meditation led to significant human progress and should be part of every individual’s devotional practice. Focused reflection on the sacred verses of the faith is especially valuable.
Fasting
Like Muslims with the month of Ramadan, the Bahá’í Faith sets aside an annual period of fasting, believing that self-restraint prepares the soul for spiritual awakening. The Bahá’í month of Ala lasts from March 2 to March 20. Bahá’ís fast from sunrise to sunset during this time.
Pilgrimage
During his exile, followers of Bahá’u’lláh made pilgrimages to visit him in Akka—what is now the city of Acre in present-day Israel. Today, Bahá’u’lláh’s shrine in Acre and the Shrine of the Bab in Haifa, Israel, have become pilgrimage sites for members of the Bahá’í Faith. These pilgrimages usually last nine days. The House of the Bab in Shiraz, Iran, and the recently destroyed House of Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdad, Iraq, have been considered pilgrimage sites in the past, but are not accessible to most Bahá’ís.
Marriage Rituals
While not obligatory, marriage is recommended among Bahá’í adherents for the companionship, contentment, and spiritual benefits it provides a man and woman. Most Bahá’í marriages adhere to the rituals of their distinct culture and may even include other religious elements. However, most Bahá’í ceremonies feature prayers and writings from Bahá’u’lláh, and require the bride and groom to recite, “We will all, verily, abide by the Will of God,” a wedding vow from the Kitab-i-Aqdas. Marriages require parental consent but not a minister.
Music/Chanting
Bahá’u’lláh described music as “a ladder by which souls may ascend to the realm on high” and approved of it as a spiritually beneficial art form. Congregational singing and melodic chanting of verses written by Bahá’u’lláh are often central to Bahá’í worship.
Initiation
Without clergy, baptism, or any form of initiation, becoming a member of the Bahá’í Faith simply requires a voluntary personal commitment to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. In most cases, a local Bahá’í community requires converts to sign a declaration and registration card proclaiming an acceptance of the Bahá’í way of life, along with belief in Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings. Bahá’ís do not proselytize.
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
The Bahá’í Faith observes several holy days in addition to its annual Nineteen-Day Fast. These take place according to the solar Bahá’í calendar, which consists of nineteen months of nineteen days each. (Four or five extra days are inserted each year to maintain synchronization with the seasons, though occasionally the dates shift in relation to the Western calendar.)
NINETEEN-DAY FAST (MARCH 2–20)
The Nineteen-Day Fast occurs on the last month of the Bahá’í year. During this time, adherents abstain from food and drink between sunrise and sunset in order to grow closer to God. Observance is required of every Bahá’í between the ages of fifteen and seventy.
NAW-RUZ (MARCH 21)
Naw-Ruz falls on the vernal equinox; it is the first day of the Bahá’í year and the end of the Nineteen-Day Fast. Bahá’ís take this day off from work and school and gather in community for a feast, prayer, and other festive activities.
RIDVAN (APRIL 20–MAY 2)
Ridvan is a twelve-day festival that commemorates Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration that he was the messenger prophesied by the Bab, made in the Garden of Ridvan near Baghdad. It is considered the holiest festival of the year. Its first, ninth, and twelfth days are especially significant, marking the arrival of Bahá’u’lláh, the arrival of Bahá’u’lláh’s family, and their departure from Ridvan on the last day. Work is suspended on these three days.
DECLARATION OF THE BAB (MAY 23)
This day celebrates the Bab’s declaration of his mission in 1844, proclaiming that he was the Hidden Imam and God’s divine messenger.
ASCENSION OF BAHÁ’U’LLÁH (MAY 29)
The ascension of Bahá’u’lláh is the solemn anniversary of Bahá’u’lláh’s death in 1892, at the age of seventy-five. This quiet holy day is marked not by celebration but by reflection.
MARTYRDOM OF THE BAB (JULY 9)
The holy anniversary of the Bab’s execution by firing squad for apostasy against Islam is remembered each year at this time. The Bab’s death took place at noon on July 9, 1850, in Tabriz, Iran.
TWIN HOLY BIRTHDAYS (OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER)
The Bab was born on October 20 and Bahá’u’lláh on November 12. But a 2014 decision by the Universal House of Justice, the group which guides the activities within the Bahá’í Faith, asserted that these days would be celebrated on the eighth new moon after Naw-Ruz. On these two days, Bahá’í faithful enjoy parties and festive feasts.
DAY OF THE COVENANT (NOVEMBER 26)
Because Bahá’í leader ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was born on the same day as the Declaration of the Bab, he never permitted his followers to observe his birthday. He finally allowed the Day of the Covenant
 , a day of celebration which commemorates the 1892 passing on of Bahá’í leadership from Bahá’u’lláh to ’Abdu’l-Bahá.
ASCENSION OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ (NOVEMBER 29)
The solemn anniversary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s death in 1821, at the age of seventy-seven, is commemorated on this day.
DIVISIONS
All but a small number Bahá’ís belong to the orthodox branch of the religion. However, a few groups have splintered from the faith over the years, primarily due to disagreements or controversies related to the succession of leaders. For example, some followers disputed that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá should lead the Bahá’í after the death of Bahá’u’lláh, some groups refused to acknowledge the authenticity of Shoghi Effendi after ’Abdu’l-Bahá died,  and some adherents disagreed with the decision to give authority to the elected members of the Universal House of Justice after Shogi Effendi’s death rather than appointing a new Bahá’í guardian.
In each case, these schisms created one or more small splinter groups, each of which the leaders of the faith identified as covenant-breakers
 . Because unity is so central to Bahá’í teaching, covenant-breakers are considered enemies of the faith and must be shunned by the true Bahá’í faithful. As a result of this strong rejection, these groups attract a very limited number of followers and tend to die out.
Those who originally challenged Bahá’u’lláh’s claim to be the true successor of the Bab are not considered covenant-breakers, because they were never Bahá’ís to begin with. These people are identified as Babis
 , members of a separate religion. Because those who leave the faith altogether are no longer considered Bahá’í, they are also not identified as covenant-breakers.
UNITY OR DIVISION
With its advocacy on behalf of human unity and world peace, along with its acceptance of the validity of other world religions, the young Bahá’í Faith has become an attractive religious option for many in a spiritually fragmented world. The Bahá’í Faith promotes equality and the common good of humankind, and has been involved in numerous social justice movements. It values science, education, environmentally friendly practices, family values, and personal ethics. It endeavors to eliminate economic divisions by reducing the extremes of wealth and poverty. Its teaching that honest work is one of the greatest forms of worship makes it a desirable religious lifestyle—one which allows its members to practice the faith without potentially burdensome rituals, ceremonies, or attendance requirements.
On the other hand, despite a passion for unity, the Bahá’í Faith has seen a number of groups splinter after disagreements related to the succession of its leaders. Because they are viewed as destroying God’s law, these Bahá’í are ostracized as covenant-breakers and viewed as enemies of the faith—even though the covenant-breakers may still consider themselves faithful Bahá’ís. For instance, in 1955, leader Shoghi Effendi wrote a seemingly gleeful message to his membership announcing the death of a covenant-breaker named Mirza Majdi’d-Din. In it, Effendi rejoiced that Majdi’d-Din met death while paralyzed and mute, brutally noting that this “incarnation of Satan” lived long enough to see the extinction of “his cherished hopes.” The condemnation of covenant-breakers is immediate, absolute, and—in a religion promoting love and acceptance—profoundly disconcerting.
INTO THE FUTURE
Though it’s one of the youngest world religions, the Bahá’í Faith has grown rapidly since the proclamations of the Bab and Bahá’u’lláh. In terms of its international geographic reach, it ranks second only to Christianity. Statistics released by the United Nations indicate it was the world’s fastest-growing religion during the twentieth century. Today it numbers at least 5 million adherents and possibly more.
What drives its growth? Despite frequent news reports about terrorism and strife, today’s world is less violent and more diverse than ever before. Racial and ethnic divisions continue to improve. One of the primary divisions between people today is religion—and that is precisely what the Bahá’í Faith seeks to remedy in its focus on the oneness of humanity and its tolerance for other faiths. If a single world religion can draw worshippers together rather than drive them apart, it’s possible that it will not be Christianity or Islam, but rather the peaceful Bahá’í Faith.SHINTO
Shinto has no supreme deity and no primary sacred text. It has no founder, no revered teacher, and no rigid set of doctrines. In fact, before other religions came to Japan, Shinto didn’t even have a name. It didn’t need one: It was what the inhabitants of the Japanese islands believed about their history, their leaders, and the spirits animating the natural world around them.
Despite its abstract nature, no religion has influenced Japan more than this indigenous faith. Shinto sustained Japan’s imperial past and was central to its actions and involvement in World War II. Today, its cities and countryside are still populated with more than 80,000 Shinto shrines. The rituals and ideas of this ancient religion permeate modern life in Japan, but very few Japanese people—only 4 million out of a country of 127 million—actually call themselves Shintoists.
The explanation for this oddity lies in the history of the religion itself. It developed before the Japanese language had its own system of writing, the folk religion of a people who revered nature and believed in spirits called kami
 . These concepts easily assimilated into other faiths as Buddhism and Confucianism entered Japan from China, and a few of the ideas of those religions found their way into Shinto practices as well. As a result, Shinto has never been an exclusive religion. Its adherents are just as likely to engage in Buddhist practices as they are to practice the rituals of Shinto. In fact, many Japanese residents regularly visit Shinto shrines out of tradition while denying they have religious faith at all.
JAPAN’S ANCIENT TRADITIONS
Shinto is such an ancient religion that it’s impossible to say when or how it began. The earliest civilization in Japan was the Yayoi culture, which dates back to the third century BCE
 . The beliefs that would eventually become known as Shinto emerged sometime between then and 400 CE
 , when residents of the islands became aware of other religious systems. Confucianism entered Japan from China in the early fifth century CE
 , along with Taoism. Buddhist teachings arrived in 522 CE
 . These new faiths prompted the local people to name their folk religion—Shinto
 comes from Chinese words meaning “the way of the gods”—and brought about other changes as well. By 712 CE
 , the myths and traditions of Shinto had been compiled into the closest document it has to a sacred text, the Kojiki. Its ethical teachings developed in response to Mahayana Buddhism, which had grown more and more powerful and soon gained approval by the ruling emperors of Japan.

Buddhism and Shinto then coexisted for several centuries—and many Japanese practiced both. Some Shinto shrines included statues of the Buddha. Some Buddhist temples featured shrines to kami
 , the divine beings of Shinto, whom some Buddhists considered supernatural entities within the karmic cycle, or even manifestations of enlightened bodhisattvas
This convergence lasted until the eighteenth century, when adherents of Shinto began working to separate the original traditions of the people from those of Buddhism. The culmination of this focus was the Meiji Restoration, a reform movement that consolidated Japan’s politics under imperial rule in 1868. Shinto became the formal state religion of Japan. Citizens respected the emperor as a divine being—one of the kami. As the government took control over local shrines, worship at these sacred places became an act of patriotism. Shinto priests instructed schoolchildren, and the government began formalizing Shinto ceremonies within matters of state. The result of these efforts brought about an explosive increase in Japanese nationalism and isolation from the rest of the world. The Shinto-based veneration of the emperor directly impacted Japan’s role in World War II.
In the aftermath of the war, Japan surrendered its claim over shrines, and Emperor Hirohito publicly relinquished any claim to divinity. Since then, Shinto has continued to thrive as one of many religions in Japan— no longer state-sponsored but still central to Japan’s culture and history.
MAJOR FIGURES
As the state religion of Japan, Shinto’s most prominent leaders have always been Japan’s emperors. Some stand out in importance, along with a few influential scholars.
Emperor Tenmu
When Emperor Tenji died in 671 CE
 , his sons, Prince Otomo and Prince Oama, fought to determine succession to the throne. Oama eventually won and renamed himself Tenmu, becoming the fortieth emperor of Japan. Emperor Tenmu commissioned the writing of the major Shinto texts, the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. Most scholars believe he commissioned the historical chronicles, especially the Nihon Shoki, to establish the legitimacy of his reign.
O no Yasumaro
A Japanese scribe and historian, O no Yasumaro completed the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki in the early eighth century, decades after the works were first commissioned by Emperor Tenmu. Though Prince Toneri, a son of Emperor Tenmu, supervised and edited the writing, scholars believe Yasumaro and other compilers performed the bulk of the work over several years.
Motoori Norinaga
An eighteenth-century Japanese scholar and practicing physician, Motoori Norinaga founded the nationalist Kokugaku academic movement, refocusing Japanese scholarship from Confucianism and Buddhism to Japan’s early Shinto classics. Writing commentaries and annotations on the Kojiki, Norinaga’s early advocacy of Japanese history and religious learning eventually led to the Meiji Restoration of Shinto to imperial Japan. His home in Matsusaka has been preserved as a commemorative museum and a Japanese national monument.
Hirata Atsutane
A former student of Taoism and Neo-Confucianism, Hirata Atsutane followed Motoori Norinaga in the Kokugaku tradition. Hirata wrote several commentaries on Shinto literature and other nationalist writings that led to the Meiji Restoration. After his death in 1843, some Shinto priests declared he had been elevated to kami
 , or godlike, status.
Emperor Meiji
Emperor Meiji was the Japanese leader who consolidated Japan’s government under imperial rule and restored state-sponsored Shinto in 1868, a period of reform and industrialization 
 now known as the Meiji Restoration. Formerly known as Prince Mutsuhito, Meiji gained the throne in 1867 and ruled until dying from health complications in 1912.
Emperor Hirohito
Also known as Emperor Showa, Hirohito, the grandson of Emperor Meiji, reigned as emperor from 1926 until his death in 1989. He ruled Japan during World War II and, rather than being tried for war crimes, was exonerated in order to maintain continuity in postwar Japan. As a consequence, he had to relinquish the imperial claim to divinity in the aftermath of the war, an action which directly challenged the Shinto claim that the lineage of emperors was divine and that all the emperors were descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu. It also ended state-sponsored Shinto ideology.
TO BE SHINTO
 “Man by nature is inherently good, and the world in which he lives is good. This is the kami-world.” —Sokyo Ono, author of Shinto the Kami Way
MAJOR TENETS
Shinto
 means “the way of the gods,” and the religion centers on godlike spirits known as kami
 . Revering the kami and maintaining a harmonious relationship between nature and people are central to Shinto.
Creation
The first man and woman, Izanagi (“The Male Who Invites”) and Izanami (“The Female Who Invites”), created the islands of Japan at the command of previously existing deities. Their offspring were the islands of Japan and the nature deities who inhabited the island’s rivers, seas, trees, mountains, and surrounding sea. All of these were kami, and everything that existed—including the Japanese people—descended from Izanagi and Izanami.
Deities
The divine spirits of Shinto are called kami
 . Though the word is generally translated as “deities” or “gods,” kami are very different from the supreme beings of monotheistic religions (see sidebar here
 ). Belief or devotion to any specific kami is not obligatory.
THREE TYPES OF KAMI
Shinto reveres divine spirits known as kami . Unrelated to Western ideas about a supreme being, the concept of kami covers a broad array of beings, from major deities like Amaterasu to the abstract divinity of rocks and trees—anything with a power different from that of an average individual. According to tradition, there are eight million kami, but in this usage, eight million represents an infinite number.
Kami are not believed to be omnipotent, are not perfect, and are not always even good. They may make mistakes or act with evil intent. Rather than dwelling in a supernatural or invisible realm, they exist within the same world as humans. They can even die and decay, just like a human. Three of the most significant categories of kami include:
Powerful Ancestors: In ancient Japan, clans would honor a certain kami as an ancestor and protector. This was particularly true of ruling families or emperors.
Extraordinary Deceased:
 Humans who showed great bravery or military achievement, particularly in wartime, are honored as kami. Some of the best-known shrines in Japan have been dedicated to military personnel, including the famed Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which pays tribute to 2.5 million people who died in war between 1869 and 1945.
Natural Powers:
 Animals, birds, rocks, mountains, forests, waterfalls, and other elements of the natural landscape are considered kami, along with destructive forces like earthquakes or tsunamis
Animism and Polytheism
With no separation between the material world and the spiritual one—and with a belief that animals, rocks, mountains, rivers, and other natural/geographic features are divine—Shinto may be described as an animistic worldview. The abundance of divine kami also makes it polytheistic.
Scriptures
Shinto has no central, authoritative scriptures or revered texts. If any books are viewed as foundational, they are the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. Both are historical texts compiled in 
 the late seventh and early eighth centuries in response to the growing influence of Buddhism. They contain traditional beliefs about kami, myths about the creation of the world, and the history of the emperors.
Ethics
Shinto offers very little in the way of a moral code but does teach that humans are born in a state of purity. Two things cause impurities, or tsumi
 . The first is personal acts of sin within human control, like evil deeds (typically viewed in the abstract rather than as particular actions). The second is external factors out of human control, like natural disaster, sickness, or contact with death. These unhappy incidents must be purified by particular rituals in order to restore productivity to the individual and the group, but typically, moral judgment is not associated with this concept. Beyond this, adherents are likely to follow the controlled, duty-bound ethical tenets of Confucianism due to its influence within Japanese culture.
Reward and Punishment
Many Japanese believe in reincarnation due to the influence of Buddhism, but teachings related to reward and punishment from one lifetime to the next do not exist within traditional Shinto.
Death and the Afterlife
Though its ceremonial practices are few, purity is essential to Shinto—and death is viewed as the ultimate source of impurity. This belief emerged from the creation story of Izanami and Izanagi. When Izanagi died, she descended to Yomi, the realm of the dead. Izanami followed her there and discovered that her body was rotting and infested with maggots—a horrifying sight that caused him to purify himself upon returning from Yomi. As a result, Shinto views death in profoundly negative terms. Shinto priests do not officiate at funerals, nor do Shinto cemeteries exist. Any death rituals observed by Shinto adherents are likely to be Buddhist ones.
Shinto teaches that the spirits of humans last beyond death. According to the Kojiki, the deceased dwell in Yomi, below the earth—a dark, shadowy destination rather than a hell-like realm of punishment. Those who do not become ancestral kami on earth spend the rest of their existence in Yomi.
MAJOR TEXTS
Shinto lacks a sacred scripture but draws much of its mythology and rituals from two ancient national histories. Both connect the imperial lineage to Amaterasu, the highest kami of the sun, in order to emphasize the divine origins of the family.
Kojiki
The Kojiki
 , or “Records of Ancient Matters,” was compiled at the request of Emperor Tenmu and presented to Empress Genmei in 711 CE
 . It tells the creation myths of the islands of Japan and the origins of the kami and also contains historical information about Japan’s imperial family, based on oral tradition. The Kojiki comprises three books, with the first consisting of mythology and the second two detailing the lives and genealogies of the first thirty-three emperors, through Empress Suiko in 638 CE . The Kojiki is the oldest book in Japanese history.
Nihon Shoki
The second oldest book in the history of Japan, the Nihon Shoki
 , or “Chronicle of Japan,” was completed and presented to Emperor Gensho in 720. Like the Kojiki, this chronological record of Japan’s history begins with the kami creation stories and ends with the accounts of the emperors through Empress Jito, the forty-first emperor, who reigned from 686 to 697.
PROMINENT KAMI
The broad range of supernatural beings within Shinto are known as kami
 . These range from nonhuman nature spirits to prominent human ancestors. Over the course of Chinese history, a number of divine kami have gained importance above others.
AMATERASU
Amaterasu is the Japanese sun goddess and best-known kami, believed to have been born from the left eye of Izanagi (one of the two “creator” kami). Amaterasu is the ruler of the heavens who sent her grandson, Ninigi, to cultivate rice in Japan. Japan’s imperial lineage arose through Ninigi, making Amaterasu the divine ancestor kami worshipped by Japanese emperors. The famous shrine in the city of Ise is devoted to Amaterasu (see sidebar here
 ), and Japan’s identity as the “Land of the Rising Sun” refers to her realm.
IZANAGI AND IZANAMI
The first male (Izanagi) and female (Izanami) kami were brother and sister as well as husband and wife. Izanami gave birth to the islands of the Japanese archipelago only to die after being burned while bearing Kagutsuchi
 , the kami of fire. A grieving Izanagi descended to Yomi
 , the realm of the dead, in an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim her. While purifying himself after his return, he created the sun kami Amaterasu from his left eye, the moon kami Tsukuyomi from his right eye, and the storm kami Susanoo from his nose.
KAGUTSUCHI
The birth of Kagutsuchi, the kami of fire, killed his mother Izanami. His father, Izanagi, killed Kagutsuchi with a sword and divided his body into eight parts. These became volcanoes. Other kami were born from the blood remaining after his execution.
HACHIMAN
Originally a kami of agriculture and fisherman who evolved into the kami of archery and warriors, Hachiman became known as Japan’s divine protector and was revered by samurai
 , the warrior aristocracy of Japan. Thousands of Japanese shrines are devoted to Hachiman.
TENJIN
The kami of education and scholarship, Tenjin originated with a historical figure named Sugawara no Michizane, a ninth-century scholar and poet. Michizane died after being exiled at the hands of a rival, an event that occurred right before an enormously destructive storm. Assuming the scholar’s spirit had caused the storm, the emperor commanded his people to worship Michizane as Tenjin
 , which means “sky deity.” Tenjin’s reputation slowly transitioned from a kami of natural disasters into a kami of learning, based on his original occupation. Today, Japanese students visit one of thousands of shrines—called Tenmangu
 —to gain his help in studying for exams.
INARI
Inari is the kami associated with fertility, rice, tea, sake, agriculture, and prosperity. Foxes are thought to be Inari’s messengers, and more Shinto shrines are dedicated to Inari—who has been depicted throughout the centuries as both male and female—than to any other kami. Offerings of rice or sake are often left at these shrines, many of which exist at corporate offices.
SHICHI FUKUJIN (SEVEN LUCKY GODS)
Each of these popular deities—otherwise known as the Seven Gods of Good Fortune, or the Seven Lucky Gods—is associated with an attribute of a prosperous life. Together, the seven are often shown on a treasure ship said to arrive on New Year’s Day to deliver gifts. These seven kami are the female Benzaiten
 (art and beauty) and the males Bishamonten
 (warriors), Hotei
 (abundance and generosity), Jurojin
 (long life), Fukurokuju
 (happiness and wealth), Daikokuten (commerce and trade), and Ebisu
 (luck).
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
Rituals are of utmost importance within Shinto, following particular patterns of purification, prayer, and offerings. They take place at a shrine or at home and always relate to the worship of kami.
Priests
A shinshoku
 (“god’s employee”), also called a kannushi
 (“god master”), is a Shinto priest who officiates in ceremonies at a shrine. The priest can be male or female and does not serve any purposes related to spiritual leadership, preaching, or teaching. Shinshoku are allowed to marry and have families. They are supported by offerings given by worshippers. High-ranking roles at important shrines have traditionally been passed down from one generation to the next, remaining in the same family for centuries.
Shrines
Thousands of large and small shrines have been constructed throughout Japan. At first, these were temporary structures, until the arrival of Buddhism introduced permanent structures dedicated to kami. Some shrines are enormous; others are tiny. They may be located alongside a road, deep within a forest, in the middle of a shopping center, or at the top of a corporate building. Marked by a symbolic gateway called a torii
 , these sacred spaces are generally associated with a single kami. Japanese attend public ceremonies at shrines and make personal offerings and prayers, often posting a message to the kami for a specific purpose. Shrines may be attended any day of the week.
TORII
The traditional gate located at the entrance of a Shinto shrine is called a torii
 , and these have come to symbolize Japan worldwide. The presence of a torii is the most recognizable way to identify a shrine or locate one on a map. The oldest torii are made of stone or wood. Their upward-curving arch and horizontal and vertical lines mark the transition between the sacredness of the shrine and the outside world. Worshippers usually bow as they pass beneath the torii.
Religious Gatherings or Services
Shinto is primarily a religion practiced individually or within the home. Its only large-scale gatherings are during festivals like Oshogatsu (see sidebar here
 ), during which many people will visit a shrine on the same day.
CEREMONIAL RECONSTRUCTION
Located in the city of Ise, the Grand Shrine, or Jingu
 , is Japan’s most famous shrine complex and one of the holiest sites in Shinto. It has long been dedicated to Amaterasu, kami of the sun. Emperor Tenmu built the first buildings at the complex in the late seventh century, yet the primary structures of the shrine itself are just a few years old. That’s because of a ceremonial reconstruction process known as shikinen sengu
 : Every twenty years, the shrines are rebuilt using all new materials, right next to the old shrines. Following a ceremony that asks Amaterasu to move into the new shrines, the old buildings are destroyed.
The reconstruction process keeps the wooden structures from eroding or decaying over time, as well as transmits traditional building techniques and the culture itself to the next generation. Surrounding trees are cut for the new shrine and always replaced by young trees. Timbers removed from the demolished shrine are reused to build or restore other shrines elsewhere in the country.
The last reconstruction year at the Ise Grand Shrine occurred in 2013 and was the sixty-second rebuilding of the shrine since its first reconstruction in 692 CE.
Miko
Young unmarried women called miko
 often assist shinshoku in priestly ceremonies and other functions at the shrine. They wear red skirts and white kimono jackets. One of their primary roles is to perform a sacred ceremonial dance called Kagura
 as a way of honoring kami. Miko are sometimes the daughters of the shinshoku.
Purification
Before entering a shrine or beginning any ritual, a Shinto devotee performs harae
 , a purification rite. He or she takes a wooden ladle in the right hand and washes the left hand, then repeats the process for the right hand, then rinses the mouth using water poured into a cupped hand. This process is thought to cleanse sin or evil. Priests may also wave a wand known as a haraigushi
 over a person or object for purification purposes. In addition to water, salt is also viewed as a purifying element. Restaurants in Japan often have salt piled near the entrance, and sumo wrestlers sprinkle salt around a wrestling ring before entering.
Offerings
At a shrine, worshippers offer money, objects, or shinsen
 —carefully prepared food offerings—in hopes of convincing kami to grant a specific request. Shinsen may involve sake, rice, fish, fruits, or vegetables, and is often prepared according to formal instructions unique to the shrine or kami.
Prayer
Within Shinto, prayers are akin to wishes, or hopes for good fortune. At a shrine, a worshipper drops a small coin into a coin box, rings a bell or strikes a gong to gain the kami’s attention, then bows twice, claps twice, and bows deeply once more before offering a wish or prayer. When clapping, the right hand (which symbolizes the worshipper) is positioned lower than the left hand (which symbolizes the kami), as a form of respect for the divine.
Other prayers may be given in the form of wooden plaques or tablets called ema
 , which means “horse picture.” These usually depict animal illustrations on one side and are blank on the other side. A worshipper writes a wish on the ema, then leaves it hanging at the shrine.
Omikuji
After making a small offering, worshippers at Shinto shrines often choose a random fortune, written on a small slip of paper, from a box. These are called omikuji
 and may be blessings or curses. Bad fortunes are usually left behind, attached to a tree or fence alongside other slips of paper, while good fortunes are typically kept. Omikuji may be the Japanese precursors of the paper predictions found in Chinese fortune cookies (which, ironically, were invented in the United States).
Kamidana
Shinto rituals and worship also occur at household shrines known as kamidana , or “god shelves.” These private home altars are always stationed above eye level and usually include a symbolic object—often a mirror, stone, or jewel—to act as a physical “home” for the kami. Even within their private households, worshippers purify their hands before praying or placing offerings of food or tea on the shelf
Ofuda
Most Shinto homes are decorated with an ofuda
 , a strip of paper, cloth, or wood featuring the name of a kami and issued by a shrine. These amulets are usually placed on a kamidana or hung somewhere in the house, and are believed to protect the people living there from sickness or other evil. New ones must be purchased every year.
Birth Rituals
Traditionally, when a newborn boy is thirty-one days old and a girl thirty-three days old, parents perform an important family ritual called miyamairi
 , which means “honorable shrine visit.” They dress the infant in akimono
 (a long, loose robe) and visit the nearest Shinto shrine, along with family and close friends. Family members and a Shinto priest recite prayers and present an offering to kami, thanking them for the gift of the baby as well as introducing them to the child.
Marriage Rituals
Though they may also include traditionally Buddhist or Christian elements, many religious weddings in Japan feature Shinto ritual and take place in a shrine. These are called shinzen kekkon
 (“marriage before the kami”). A Shinto priest may officiate the ceremony and announce the marriage to the kami. Central to the ceremony is the san san kudo
 ritual, during which the bride and groom each take three sips from three small cups of sake. The bride and groom wear traditional kimonos for this part of the ceremony, but may change into more Western-style wedding attire for the rest of the wedding. These ceremonies are fairly new, popularized in 1900 by the imperial wedding of Prince Yoshihito and Kujo Sadako.
Dancing and Music
The oldest Shinto myths tell of the goddess of dawn and revelry using music and dance to persuade Amaterasu, the sun goddess, to emerge from a cave. A theatrical ritual dance called Kagura
 originated from this myth. Kagura dances are performed to honor the kami on special occasions, usually by miko
 —young, unmarried assistants at Shinto shrines. The word Kagura
 means “entertainment of the gods” and includes music played on traditional Japanese flutes and a stringed instrument called theyamatogoto
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
Shinto festivals are known as matsuri
 and are observed to honor and show gratitude to kami. The largest are tied to agricultural seasons— particularly rice farming—and involve parades, feasting, dancing, and colorful decorations. While there are many different festivals during the year depending on the shrine and region, these are four of the most nationally significant.
OSHOGATSU (JANUARY 1)
The Shinto New Year’s festival, Oshogatsu
 is a time during which most Japanese residents attend a shrine to pray for good fortune, even if they don’t consider themselves Shintoists. Japan’s largest shrines are especially crowded during these days.
OHARAE (JUNE 30, DECEMBER 31)
These biannual group purification rituals take place at the midpoint of the year and on the final day of the year. In imperial Japan, the emperor would conduct a large-scale purification ritual for the entire country for the purpose of warding off impurities or natural disasters. Today, individual Japanese people conduct their own purification rites on these days.
SHICHI-GO-SAN (NOVEMBER 15)
Shichi-Go-San
 is a popular life-cycle festival for seven-year-old girls, five-year-old boys, and three-year-old girls (shichi-go-san
 means “seven-five-three”). The children in question wear traditional kimonos and attend rite-of-passage blessing ceremonies at Shinto shrines. Three-year-old girls and five-year-old boys are welcomed into the community. Seven-year-old girls consider this their entrance into womanhood.
DIVISIONS
With few systematic beliefs or institutional practices, Shinto is hardly formal enough to have true branches or denominations. It does, however, have a few categorical divisions.
Koshitsu
Koshitsu
 is state-sponsored Shinto, with rites performed by the emperor of Japan on behalf of the entire country. It has not been practiced since the end of World War II.
Jinja
Jinja Shinto
 is the traditional practice of Shinto. Most Shintoists in Japan fall into this category. Observance generally occurs at any of the nearly 80,000 shrines throughout Japan that are overseen by the Jinja Honcho (the Association of Shinto Shrines), an administrative organization that seeks to preserve Shinto’s faith and traditions.
Minzoku
Minzoku
 is folk Shinto and is usually practiced at rural shrines by common people. Many of the folk rituals evolved alongside Jinja Shinto centuries ago, but Minzoku assimilated Buddhist and/or Taoist elements that distinguish it from more traditional versions of Shinto.
Kyoha
Kyoha
 , also known as Sect Shinto
 , sprung up in the 1800s, with each sect having its own founder. Thirteen sects were eventually recognized by the imperial government. As many of these groups arose out of Jinja Shinto, they tend to maintain related practices and beliefs; however, they no longer consider themselves Shinto. Today, they function as independent religions.
HARMONY OR WARFARE
By and large, Shinto is a peaceful religion. It values tradition, reveres the family, and honors ancestors. Shinto adherents seek to live happy lives and believe that humanity is basically good. The religion’s reverence for natural things—including the kami present in the forests, streams, and mountains—promotes a built-in environmental commitment that has been a positive force in today’s world. Shinto practitioners seek harmony with nature, and the religion’s influence has led to the establishment of numerous ecological sanctuaries in Japan.
Reverence for the Japanese emperor as a descendant of Amaterasu—along with belief in the divinity of the royal family—contributed to a strong nationalist sentiment in the early twentieth century. In particular, the tenets of Shinto were one of the things that inspired Japanese soldiers to value kamikaze
 suicide attacks during World War II. Such a death would not only earn soldiers commemoration at the Yasukuni Shrine—which honored those who perished in warfare and was often visited by the emperor—but would also turn them into revered guardian kami.
INTO THE FUTURE
Shinto is deeply embedded in the historical and contemporary culture of Japan. If the country’s 127 million people share a religious tradition, it is Shinto. But while millions of people may welcome the New Year in a Shinto shrine or perform certain Shinto rituals, very few consider themselves dedicated followers of the religion.
One reason for this is the doctrinal looseness of Shinto. Another obstacle is the increasing secularization of Japan. Like other developed nations, its citizens are becoming less religious every year. Many in this technologically advanced society—particularly its young people—simply have no interest in an ancient religion that promotes harmony with mountains and trees. For them, the public ceremonies of Shinto have more to do with habit or tradition than with spiritual reflection.
As Japanese culture evolves, the “primitive” ideas of Shinto may continue to permeate the nation’s way of life. But with no missionary emphasis, no scriptures, a falling Japanese birth rate, and few prospects for growth outside Japan, Shinto’s future as a standalone religion may be limited.JAINISM
The sixth century BCE
 was a formative time for the world’s religious systems. In the Far East, Confucius and Laozi were developing followings. In Eastern India, the Buddha had begun teaching a path separate from Hinduism. And in the same region, a young prince named Mahavira abandoned his possessions and embarked on a life of extreme asceticism in the pursuit of moksha
 —liberation from the Hindu cycle of karma and rebirth.
Not only did Mahavira achieve liberation, according to tradition, but he also ended up defining a new religion. He and his followers rejected the Hindu Vedas and the complex system of Hindu gods. They viewed the soul as pure and the body as evil, a dualist outlook that led to a radical focus on asceticism. Believing that depriving the body was the surest path toward moksha, Mahavira’s followers sought complete detachment from worldly things like clothing, food, and even shelter. They practiced an extreme version of ahimsa
 , or nonviolence.
The resulting belief system eventually became known as Jainism
 , an ethics-based religion with no deity. The name Jain
 comes from the exalted position of Mahavira and twenty-three other wise role models of the faith. Known as jinas
 , from the Sanskrit word for “conqueror,” these great teachers are believed to have conquered the attachments of the body, attained omniscience, and become pure soul.
A small movement when it began, Jainism remains small today, primarily confined to the Indian subcontinent. Many Westerners haven’t even heard of this religion. Yet Jain teachings on nonviolence have spread worldwide, and its adherents are some of the most successful and, ironically, wealthy Indians today.
PURIFICATION THROUGH SELF-DENIAL
Around the sixth century BCE
 , a thirty-year-old prince named Mahavira left his home in Eastern India, abandoned all his worldly possessions, and even stripped himself of his clothing in the pursuit of moksha. He spent the next twelve years meditating until, according to tradition, he achieved infinite knowledge. For the next three decades, Mahavira taught the philosophies of Jainism until, at the age of seventy-two, during a lengthy fast, he conquered worldly attachments like pride and greed, left his mortal body, and attained moksha. Mahavira became pure soul.
Mahavira’s followers believed him to be the twenty-fourth and final tirthankara , or great religious teacher who attains liberation and shows others the path to it. Tirthankara
 means “crossing-maker,” and these teachers were a special type of jina
 (enlightened one) who not only possesses unlimited spiritual power but also showed their followers how to cross the metaphorical river of suffering via Jainism. By the time of his death, Mahavira had founded a monastic community with thousands of monks and nuns, all working to purify themselves and the world around them through self-denial.

 The Agamas
Jains follow the teachings of these tirt-hankaras. While they claim their faith is eternal, Jainism historically arose around the same time Buddhism did, splitting off from Hinduism but maintaining several points of connection with it. Mahavira is often considered the founder of the religion, but Jains believe he was only the most recent of the tirthankaras.
By the fourth century CE
 , the community of Jains had compiled their sacred writings, split into two distinct sects, moved from Eastern India into Western and Central India, and begun building beautiful temples. Like the tirthankaras, Jains sought liberation by pursuing right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. This threefold path became known as Ratnatraya
 , or the Three Jewels.
MAJOR FIGURES
The twenty-four founding tirthankaras are the most important figures to the Jains, alongside a handful of scholars and philosophers.
Rishabhanatha
The first jina and the first tirthankara, Rishabhanatha was a great warrior who taught nonviolence and began pursuing asceticism after the Hindu god Indra sent a dancer to awaken him to the need for self-denial. Rishabhanatha gave away his kingdom and possessions to his one hundred sons and spent the next thousand years striving for omniscience. Upon achieving it, he traveled across India teaching Jainism, and eventually attained moksha. Though no evidence exists that Rishabhanatha was a historical figure, he is mentioned in the Hindu Puranas by the name Rishabha, one of the avatars of Vishnu.
Bahubali
Bahubali was the son of Rishabhanatha who gave up his royal position after a duel with his brother, Bharata. Bahubali refused to kill Bharata, gave up his clothing and possessions, and became a monk. He meditated for a year without moving—according to tradition, vines grew up around his body—and his pursuit of contemplation eventually allowed him to attain liberation and become pure soul. Digambara Jains believe Bahubali was the first person to reach moksha. The fifty-seven-foot statue of Bahubali in Shravanabelagola, India, is one of the world’s largest freestanding statues and a pilgrimage site for Jains.
Parshvanatha
The twenty-third tirthankara of Jainism and the earliest jina historians recognize as an actual historical figure, Parshvanatha is thought to have lived from 872 to 772 BCE
 , spending his first thirty years as a prince—just like Mahavira—before setting out in pursuit of enlightenment. After eighty-four days of meditation, he obtained omniscience. He attained moksha at the age of 100. Jains believe Parshvanatha had 164,000 male followers at the time of his death, along with twice as many female followers.
Mahavira
Mahavira was the final tirthankara. Jains believe he lived from 599 to 527 BCE
 , but Western historians date his lifespan to a century later. Some believe he could have been a contemporary of the Buddha. Most of Jain philosophy begins with the teachings of Mahavira, including its Five Great Vows of ahimsa
 (nonviolence), satya
 (truth), asteya
 (non-stealing), brahmacharya
 (celibacy), and aparigraha
 (non-possession). His story is told in the Acharanga Sutra
 , the first and oldest of Agamas, the Jain scriptures.
Chandragupta Maurya
The founder of the extensive Mauryan Empire, which at the time was one of the largest in the world, Chandragupta Maurya helped free India from Greek rule and unified its divided kingdoms into a single state. 
 In 297 BCE
 , he abdicated his throne to his son Bindusara and embraced Jainism. Chandragupta traveled to Southern India with Jain monks, where he lived as an ascetic before voluntarily starving to death at the end of his life, a practice known as sallekhana
Amoghavarsha I
An emperor of the powerful Rashtrakuta dynasty in India, Amoghavarsha ruled for sixty-four years in the ninth century CE
 , one of the longest reigns in world history. A scholar and poet, he also wrote the famed literary work Kavirajamarga
 (“Royal Path for Poets”) and was believed to have become a committed follower of the Digambara sect of Jainism after renouncing his throne.
TO BE JAIN
 “I ask pardon of all living creatures, may all of them pardon me, may I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none.”
—the Pratikraman Sutra, a Jain prayer
Acharya Hemachandra
A Jain scholar and poet in the early twelfth century, Acharya Hemachandra advised King Kumarpal of the Solanki dynasty and helped build the great Jain temple complex at Taranga, a pilgrimage site for both the Digambara and Svetambara sects. Thanks to his influence, the state of Gujarat adopted Jainism as its official religion and banned animal sacrifice.
Shrimad Rajchandra
Born in 1867 to a Jain mother and Hindu father, Shrimad Rajchandra claimed at the age of seven to remember his past lives. He went on to become a prolific writer and public speaker best known for his written correspondence in the late nineteenth century with Mahatma Gandhi, who called Rajchandra one of the most influential people in his life. Rajchandra died at the age of thirty-two after a long illness.
Virchand Gandhi
An Indian religious scholar, lawyer, and lecturer, Virchand Gandhi attended the 1893 World Parliament of Religions in Chicago to represent Jainism. Though his fellow Jains were critical of the idea of a lengthy sea voyage—viewing it as an affront to asceticism—Gandhi traveled anyway in order to teach Westerners the concept of nonviolence (ahimsa
 ). His teachings were reported in a variety of US publications before he returned to India. The historic play Gandhi Before Gandhi
 tells the story of his life.
MAJOR TENETS
Of all the Indian religions, Jainism is by far the most ascetic, believing self-denial to be the path toward spiritual enlightenment and liberation.
Creation
Jains do not believe that a being or force created the word. On the contrary, the universe and everything in it have always existed. Time is eternal and cyclical.
Deity
Jainism does not recognize a creator deity, supreme god, or all-powerful divine force. However, Jains do revere tirthankaras as guides who help individuals on the path to enlightenment. Some Jains acknowledge lesser divine beings associated with the tirthankaras.
Tirthankaras
A succession of twenty-four great religious teachers, known as tirthankaras
 , or “crossing-makers,” who attain moksha, become siddha
 (“pure soul”), and act as role models for those seeking similar liberation. The last tirthankara was Mahavira.
Scriptures
Jains have a unique relationship to scripture. Due to a vow of nonattachment, Jain monks and nuns were once not allowed to own religious texts and therefore had to memorize them—until a famine in the fourth or third century BCE
 threatened to destroy this oral tradition. As monks began to die, a council convened to put the tradition into writing. These sacred writings are the Agamas, which contain the teachings of Mahavira. The Purvas are fourteen additional sacred writings thought to have been lost in the famine. Jainism’s Digambara sect believes the Purvas are the true teachings of the tirthankaras and rejects the authority of the compiled Agamas.
Samsara
Samsara
 is the worldly cycle of death and rebirth, similar to of the one described in Hinduism and popularly known as reincarnation
 . Jains believe a soul can be reborn as any living thing, including humans, animals, plants, and even stones. Samsara continues as long as a soul is in bondage to its karma
 —which Jains believe is an actual substance that builds up on the soul.
Karma
Jains conceive of karma as a material substance that attaches to the soul and weighs it down, constraining it in the temporal cycle of samsara. Like a form of pollution, accumulated karma obscures the purity and power of the soul. A life of asceticism, based on an individual’s actions and intentions, is the only way to diminish or remove karma.
Moksha
Moksha
 is the spiritual enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of samsara that occurs after a soul has become freed from karma. At this point, the soul abandons its mortal body and becomes siddha
Siddha
Siddhas
 are pure souls that have removed their karma and attained moksha. Traditionally, siddhas are immortal, perfected beings who dwell in Siddhashila
 , a realm of infinite bliss at the apex of the universe. In Jainism, a siddha is revered like a saint.
Asceticism
Central to Jainism and the pursuit of moksha is asceticism
 , or severe self-discipline for religious purposes. To reach liberation, a soul must not be burdened by any worldly pleasures. Monks in the Digambara sect of Jainism renounce all possessions—including clothing—spending their lives completely naked and eating only from their hands. Fasting is a common practice, and strict vegetarian diets are the norm. Additionally, Jains are expected to meditate for forty-eight minutes a day to achieve a state of perfect calmness.
Ahimsa
Ahimsa is the Jain ideal of nonviolence, similar to Hinduism’s reverence for life but far more comprehensive. Jains vow not to destroy life in any sense by their thoughts, words, or actions, seeking to minimize harm to all living creatures—even unintentional harm. Ahimsa extends beyond people and animals. For instance, Jains avoid eating root vegetables like potatoes or carrots, believing them to be the life essence of a plant, and take great care not to injure insects or other tiny organisms.
CAREERS FOR JAINS
Jains’ commitment to ahimsa means many occupations are forbidden for them. All substances, including rocks and trees, are considered living beings, and a commitment to nonviolence requires refusing to injure these substances in any way. As a result, Jains have always avoided jobs like farming (plowing the soil can injure plants or insects), metalwork (hammering on an anvil harms the metal), and carpentry (cutting or sanding wood causes it pain). Instead, most Jains turned to financial careers like moneylending or trading. That’s why many members of India’s upper class are Jains.
How do they reconcile their wealth despite with the teachings of a religion that emphasizes poverty and asceticism? Affluent Jains approach their faith with pragmatism, assuming that the attainment of moksha will not likely occur during their lifetime, which means rebirth is a certainty. From that same perspective comes the belief that wealth is a birthright—evidence of righteousness in a previous life—which should be used to benefit the larger Jain community.
Virtues
In general, Jains are to practice service to others, patience, humility, politeness, and generosity. This commitment to giving especially applies to the support of monks and nuns, who are only permitted to accept 
 certain gifts without blame. These donations include food and water, clothing, blankets, and beds.
Sin and Purification
Sins within Jainism are actions that cause the accumulation of negative karma, or papa . Jains are taught to avoid eighteen different categories of sin, from relatively minor transgressions (possessiveness or deceit) to major wrongdoing (violence or killing). As in Hinduism, Jains believe that punya
 , or virtuous actions, must take place in order to purify the soul by removing papa
Death and the Afterlife
At the end of life, the most devout Jains, including laypeople, pursue an intentional death by starvation called sallekhana
 . Conducted under the supervision of a spiritual leader, it has long been viewed as an ideal death that often precedes the attainment of moksha. After all, a purposeful death symbolizes intense nonattachment to the things of the world. Jains define sallekhana
 as a peaceful act of purification from karma, rather than a form of suicide, which involves self-harm and is forbidden. However, outside the faith, this practice is highly controversial. Suicide is a crime in India, which is one reason sallekhana was practiced far more often among Jains in the past.
While Jains believe that time is cyclical and the soul endures multiple lifetimes before attaining moksha, they do not rule out 
 the possibility that a soul may be reborn in a hell-like netherworld. In these realms, past karma may necessitate a temporary period of suffering or torture. This hell is known as Naraka
 —as in Hinduism—and is primarily the dwelling place of Jain souls who have killed, caused intense pain, or sought an excessive amount of pleasure. Naraka is said to exist in the lowest part of the universe.
On the other hand, a heavenly realm known as Siddhashila
 , located at the top of the universe, is the dwelling place of those who attain moksha. Upon being liberated from their mortal bodies, siddhas become pure soul, gain infinite knowledge, and dwell in bliss.
THE FIVE GREAT VOWS
Jain adherents take five vows known as the Mahavratas
 . While these vows apply to all followers of the religion, ascetic monks and nuns, who believe extreme self-denial is necessary for the attainment of moksha, hold them most strictly. The Five Great Vows are as follows:
Ahimsa:
 The vow of nonviolence to all things. One way lay Jains follow this vow is by only using flowers that have fallen from a plant, rather than cutting a living flower. A Jain monk may wear a mask over his mouth to keep from accidentally inhaling a small insect. Practicing Jains are vegetarian.
Aparigraha:
 The vow of detachment. Jains limit their possessions because attachment to worldly items can cause greed or selfishness. Monks and nuns give up almost all worldly possessions. Digambara monks have no clothing, no home, and no bowl for food—they must receive food using only their cupped hands.
Asteya:
 The vow not to steal. Jains are prohibited from taking anything not willingly offered. For lay Jains, this involves always paying fair value for goods or services.
Brahmacharya:
 The vow of celibacy for monks and nuns, and of fidelity for married lay Jains. For ascetics, this includes abstinence from sensual pleasure and any sexual thoughts. One reason Digambara monks spend their lives naked is to abandon any sexual feelings related to modesty or body image.
Satya:
 The vow to speak the truth. This vow may only be broken if speaking the truth leads to violence, in which case silence is preferred.
MAJOR TEXTS
Jains don’t have a particular scripture considered their ultimate source for truth or practice. In fact, for centuries, Jains could not possess sacred books, because attachment to these physical documents was believed to conflict with the religion’s strict asceticism. Once these standards relaxed slightly in the fourth century, Jain tradition began to draw from several holy texts.
Agamas
The most important scriptures of Jainism, the Agamas are based on the teachings of Mahavira. Containing forty-six texts, the Agamas were once passed along orally until they were compiled as written works in the fourth or third century BCE
 . This process was controversial, and the two main sects of the faith disagree about which parts of these teachings were actually written down. The Digambara sect believes the original scriptures—the Purvas—did not survive and therefore reject the authority of the Agamas, which are the primary canon of the Svetambara Jains.
Purvas
The Purvas are fourteen sacred texts believed to have been lost before the Agamas were compiled. According to tradition, the Purvas contained the entirety of universal knowledge, but all the monks who memorized them died before the teachings could be transcribed. However, a table of contents of the Purvas did survive, detailing their subject matter, in a section of the Agamas. Digambara Jains believe that two fragments of the Purvas, the Siddhanta, were also transcribed in the second century CE
 . These are their primary sacred texts. The title Purvas
 means “ancient knowledge.”
Kalpa Sutra
Also known as the Book of Ritual
 , this text was believed to have been written in the fourth century BCE
 , or around 150 years after Mahavira attained moksha. It details the lives of Mahavira, Parshvanatha, and the other tirthankaras. Considered one of the holiest texts in the religion, it is read every year during Paryushana, a multiday festival of study and fasting. Only Svetambara Jains consider the Kalpa Sutra
 authentic.
Tattvartha Sutra
The one Jain text viewed as authoritative by both the Digambaras and Svetambaras, the Tattvartha Sutra
 , written in Sanskrit during the second century CE
 , summarizes the primary doctrines of Jainism—from identifying the types of knowledge to the process of shedding karma and attaining moksha.
Acharanga Sutra
One of Jainism’s central sacred writings and part of the Agamas, this text describes the code of conduct for ascetics as taught by Mahavira. Svetambara Jains follow these teachings. Digambara Jains do not recognize this text as authentic and have their own set of ascetic teachings called Mulachara
Dravyasamgraha
One of the most popular and important sacred texts of the Digambara sect of Jainism, the Dravyasamgraha
 was written in the tenth century by the teacher Nemichandra. It emphasizes meditation, defines the Three Jewels (Ratnatraya
 ), and describes methods for attaining moksha. Devout Digambara Jains often memorize this relatively short text.
THE SYMBOL OF JAINISM
While many religious symbols are simplistic in design—for example, Christianity’s cross, Islam’s star and crescent, and Judaism’s five-pointed star—Jainism has a complex, somewhat difficult to describe symbol that represents its beliefs. This symbol was chosen in 1974 by the worldwide community of Jains on the 2,500th anniversary of Mahavira’s attainment of moksha.
•
 The solitary dot
 at the top represents the liberated soul, or siddha
 , elevated above all else.
•
 The three dots
 below it represent the Three Jewels (Ratnatraya
 ), or the threefold path to moksha.
•
 The swastika
 represents the four states in which a soul may be reborn: Svarga (heaven), Humanity, Plant or Animal, and Naraka (hell). An ancient symbol in Indian religions, the swastika—from the Sanskrit word svastika
 —has been in prominent use since long before it was adopted by Nazi Germany.
•
 The open hand with a wheel
 refers to the stop of samsara. The wheel with twenty-four spokes represents the twenty-four tirthankaras, with the script symbol for ahimsa, or nonviolence, inside it.
•
 Below the image is often written a mantra
 known as the Parasparopagraho Jivanam
 , which states, “All life is bound together by mutual support and interdependence.”
•
 The shape of the structure itself represents the three realms of the cosmos—the upper portion is heaven, the lower portion is hell, and the middle section is the material world.
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
Though lay Jains don’t seek as austere a lifestyle as the religion’s monks and nuns, regular worship and religious practices are still 
 important in everyday life. Every aspect of Jain devotion is in pursuit of removing karma from the soul and, ultimately, attaining a state of liberation. This is achieved by adhering to a three-part ethical code known as the Three Jewels
 . These “jewels” are right knowledge (samyak jnana
 ), or proper understanding of the universe and Jain teachings; right faith (samyak darshana
 ), a determination to discover the truth; and right conduct (samyak charitra
 ), living according to the guidelines of Jainism.
Leaders of Worship
Because ascetics are valued so highly among Jains, a priestly class has never been a significant part of Jain worship. Jain temples are often overseen by priest-like pujari
 , who conduct puja and other daily rituals. Pujari simply assist with ceremonies and are often Hindus or members of other faiths. The foods used in puja are given to non-Jain pujari; Jains are not allowed to consume them.
Temples
Jain temples, which often act as pilgrimage sites, are dedicated not to a deity but to the tirthankaras. These ornate structures are built to resemble the tirthankaras’ imagined dwelling place in the realm of bliss, and often contain murti
 , or statues, of them. Devout Jains make small offerings and recite mantras in the presence of the murti.
Prayer
On a daily basis, the faithful Jain folds his or her hands, bows to the four cardinal directions, and recites the Navkar Mantra (see sidebar below), honoring the five supreme classes of being. Jains do not ask for help or mercy in prayer, though some may occasionally appeal to Hindu gods or revered siddhas for assistance, believing them to be associated with the tirthankaras (see here
 ).
During attendance at a temple, a number of mantras
 , or chanted prayers, are said at various times. Upon entering the temple, Jains says, “Nisihi,” a word related to renunciation, indicating restraint from worldly activities. Jains repeat this word once again before entering the inner section of the temple and after the completion of puja
 , or ritual cleansing.
A COMMON PRAYER: NAVKAR MANTRA
Jains do not pray to ask for favors from a deity, but do recite a sacred mantra when meditating or approaching the image of a tirthankara. The Navkar Mantra is the first step in any act of worship and offers a gesture of respect toward those further along the path toward moksha:
I bow down to the Arihanta [tirthankaras]
I bow down to the Siddha. I bow down to Acharya [monastic leaders]. I bow down to Upadhyaya [monastic teachers]. I bow down to Sadhu and Sadhvi [monks and nuns]. These five bowing downs destroy all the sins. Amongst all that is auspicious, this Navkar Mantra is the foremost
Dravya Puja
In Jain temples, worshippers perform puja
 rituals dedicated to the sacred statues (murti
 ) of the tirthankaras. This process is known as dravya puja
 (worship with objects) and involves bathing the statue with purified water or nectar, then setting symbolic offerings of sandalwood paste, flowers, incense, a lamp or candle, uncooked rice, sweets, and fruit or nuts before the murti. These particular offerings each correlate to a Jain belief (for instance, the flame of the candle or lamp represents a siddha
 , or soul unencumbered 
 by karma). The worshipper sings the praises of the tirthankara throughout and, when the process is complete, prostrates himself or herself three times before the tirthankara, walks backward to the door while maintaining eye contact, and bows in reverence. Parts of this ritual vary according to region.
Religious Gatherings
Though Jains may end up performing puja in a temple at the same time as each other, worship is primarily an individual practice in the pursuit of purification or the removal of bad karma. The only true community activities take place during festivals and processions, like Mahavir Jayanti (see sidebar here
 ).
TO BE JAIN
 “Do not injure, abuse, oppress, enslave, insult, torment, torture, or kill any creature or living being.” —Mahavira, the final tirthankara
Household Shrines
Most Jains have a shrine at home for worship. Made of carved wood, these shrines are typically small versions of the shrines to tirthankara at Jain temples. The same puja rites may be performed at home as at a temple.
Attire
Jains remove their shoes and socks before entering a temple to perform puja. They wear a special type of unstitched white clothing—a garment that can never have been worn while eating, drinking, or using the restroom. Upon putting on these clothes, a Jain anoints his or her body with saffron paste on the forehead, earlobes, neck, and navel. These practices also apply when worshipping at household shrines.
Samayika
Each day, a practicing Jain meditates for forty-eight minutes, or one-thirtieth of the day. Called samayika
 , this meditation is for the purpose of becoming at peace with the world, keeping one’s thoughts from evil, and focusing on the teachings of Jainism.
Initiation
While most Jains enter the faith because it is the family’s tradition, anyone may become a Jain. There are no specific conversion or baptism rituals. Instead, an individual may declare him- or herself a Jain after studying the faith, understanding its teachings, and then adopting the Jain lifestyle and the Mahavratas
 , or the Five Great Vows.
Wedding Rituals
Before a wedding, separate puja ceremonies take place at the homes of the bride and groom. The wedding ceremony itself occurs in a wedding hall under a four-posted canopy called a mandap
 , beneath which the bride and groom sit. After several traditional rituals, the bride and groom perform a ceremony 
 called granthi bandhan
 , during which they knot together the bride’s sari, a
 draped garment, with a cloth worn by the groom. The bride and groom recite vows and holy mantras before exchanging garlands made of flowers.
DIVISIONS
While there are few doctrinal or ceremonial differences between lay Jains, two distinct monastic groups split during a schism that came to completion during the first century CE
 . Only 6,000 in number—out of 4 million Jains in India—these two groups agree on the basics but disagree on several corollary points.
Digambara (“Sky Clad”)
The most austere monks and nuns, Digambara Jains reject the authority of the Agamas, believe women are unable to attain moksha, and require monks to live completely naked (clad only in the “sky”). They believe clothes should be included among the possessions a monk renounces. Because modesty is related to sexuality, modesty itself must be abandoned. Washing clothes can also unintentionally do violence to small organisms or insects. Digambara monks have no eating utensils and must receive food by cupping their hands into a bowl. Their only possession is a whisk made from peacock feathers, which they use to brush insects away from their path as they walk. The eyes of Digambara statues are always sculpted or painted to appear downcast.
Because Digambara Jains believe nudity is a prerequisite to the attainment of moksha—and because they prohibit women from being nude in public—a woman cannot be liberated from samsara until she is reborn as a male.
A subsect of Digambara called Taranapantha
 began in the early sixteenth century. Its followers focus more on sacred literature and spiritual values than on images of tirthankaras, rejecting the practice as a form of idol worship.
Svetambara (“White Clad”)
Members of this Jain sect wear white clothing and have three possessions: a staff, a whisk for insects, and a bowl for begging. They wear a loincloth and a shoulder-cloth, keeping a square mask over their mouths to prevent the accidental inhalation of insects. Svetambara Jains wander the countryside during the dry season, begging for food near temples and sites of pilgrimage and often staying in abandoned buildings to avoid disturbing others. They accept the authority of the Agamas. The eyes of Svetambara statues are created to be visible to the viewer, staring straight ahead
A subsect of Svetambara called Sthanakvasi
 emerged in 1653 CE
 . Its leaders taught that idol worship was not necessary to the pursuit of moksha. Sthanakwasi avoid temples and murti of tirthankaras, meeting in religious prayer halls called sthanakas
 . Both the nonidolatrous Digambara and Svetambara reform movements were likely influenced by the arrival of Islam to India.
THE GOOD AND THE BAD
The Jain concept of ahimsa
 , or total harmlessness in one’s behavior, has filtered into the world through the teachings and influence of leaders like Mahatma Gandhi—who admitted to being deeply influenced by Jain philosophy—and Martin Luther King, Jr., who visited Gandhi in India and learned from his peaceful activism. Though small in number, today’s Jains play a prominent and mostly positive role in India as influential merchants and financial leaders.
Jains practice bal diksha
 , a centuries-old religious tradition in which children renounce the material world and all relationships to begin a life of devotion as an ascetic. This highly valued commitment is sometimes begun by children as young as three years old. It has been criticized often by children’s-rights organizations and is the subject of legislation.
Women have a degraded position among some Jains, especially those of the Digambara sect, who believe only a male can achieve moksha. Liberation of the soul is not possible for women until they are reborn as males. (Svetambara Jains disagree with this.)
The practice of sallekhana
 , or intentional death by fasting near the end of life, has often been challenged in India. These deaths are celebrated by family members and praised by members of the faith, but human-rights organizations categorize sallekhana as a form of suicide or euthanasia—both of which are forbidden in India.
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
Festivals are an essential element of Jain worship throughout the year. Other than the multiday Paryushana, these are generally one-day events that involve fasting, penitence, and special services in the temple.
DIWALI (OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER)
While Diwali is celebrated throughout India as an important Hindu festival, Jains believe it also represents the anniversary of Mahavira’s final teaching and attainment of moksha. Like Hindus, Jains light candles during the “Festival of Lights” and give sweets to children. Some Jains fast during Diwali.
MAHAVIR JAYANTI (MARCH OR APRIL)
Mahavir Jayanti is a celebration of the birth of Mahavira. Jains assemble in temples, where a murti
 , or statue, of Mahavira is paraded in a procession while worshippers anoint the image and recite specific chants and prayers. Monks and nuns read or lecture from Mahavira’s teachings.
PARYUSHANA (AUGUST)
Paryushana is a year-end celebration, according to the Jain calendar, during which lay Jains are encouraged to spend time living as ascetics— including spending at least twenty-four hours meditating in a monastery. For eight days (or ten days for Digambara Jains), the faithful fast, study, confess sins, perform puja, and seek forgiveness for any offenses toward their fellow man.
KARTIK PURNIMA (NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER)
The sacred hills surrounding Palitana are closed during the rainy months. This area is where the first tirthankara, Rishabhanatha, is thought to have meditated before delivering his first sermon. This festival marks the conclusion of the monsoon season and the reopening of the area. Many Jains mark this day with a pilgrimage to the temples and hills of Palitana.
INTO THE FUTURE
Should a religion with no beginning be concerned about coming to an end? That’s the question facing many modern Jains, especially as Hinduism and Islam flourish in India while Jainism remains a distinct minority. Compounding the problem is the slow growth of Jainism outside India. With only a few hundred thousand Jains in the West—mostly in the United States and the United Kingdom—the religion has been slow to spread. The monks and nuns who figure so prominently in Jain rites and rituals are confined to India, and the overall asceticism of the faith isolates Jains from the excesses of Western culture. Jains have built a few temples outside India, but whether or not the Jain way of life can survive away from the country where it began remains uncertain … as does its long-term survival in India.ZOROASTRIANISM
The supreme creator of the universe is entirely good. However, evil exists in the world he created, the result of a wicked adversary who hates goodness and opposes the supreme deity. Humans live in this world of good and evil, and must choose between the two. After death, their souls will live on, and each individual will be judged for his or her deeds. Those who resist evil—whose thoughts, words, and actions are deemed righteous—will be rewarded with entry to an eternal paradise and the presence of the creator. Those who embrace wickedness and practice evil will face punishment in a dark abyss, which is home to the evil being and his minions.
The previous paragraph will sound familiar to a majority of the world’s religious people. Does it describe the Christian worldview? Maybe the teachings of Islam? Some of those statements even fit within Judaism. However, these are the basic tenets of Zoroastrianism, an ancient faith that predates Christianity and Islam and developed alongside the Jewish faith. And although it is a subject of much scholarly debate, this religion may have existed far earlier than those religions.
Founded by a prophet named Zoroaster, this faith was once one of the largest and most powerful in the world. Today, its adherents are only a small population of people in Iran and India, but its influence may have spread throughout the world’s greatest religions.
THE UNDILUTED STAR
Who was Zarathustra? This ancient name has an indistinct meaning related to camels, but the Greek version of the name, Zoroaster
 , is clear: it literally means “undiluted star” or “shining light.” Unfortunately, the historical truth about the prophet who went by that name has been diluted by time. Most historians do believe he existed, but they aren’t quite sure when.
The ancient Greeks claimed that Zoroaster lived a full 6,000 years before Plato and 5,000 years before the siege of Troy. This would have put him on earth far earlier than even the ancient Egyptians.
The traditions of the faith itself disagree. The Zoroastrian scriptures indicate Zoroaster lived 258 years before Alexander the Great’s defeat of the first Persian Empire in 330 BCE
 , which would put his lifetime around 600 BCE
 . Based on linguistic and cultural studies of those scriptures, modern scholarship suggests he may have lived around 1400 to 1200 BCE.

Despite this uncertainty, a few things are clear about Zoroaster’s life. He came from a prominent family and was likely a priest in a polytheistic religion similar to the ancient Vedas of India. Sometime before 600 BCE
 , Zoroaster had a vision during a ritual bath in a river. A being of light appeared and guided him into the presence of Ahura Mazda
 (“wise lord”), the uncreated creator and source of everything good. Other visions followed. In these revelations, Zoroaster learned that all the other gods were demonic creations of Angra Mainyu
 , the destructive spirit who opposed Ahura Mazda. The world itself was a cosmic battle between the forces of good and evil, played out in the lives of humanity, which would someday end with the final defeat of evil by the all-powerful Ahura Mazda.
By the time of Persia’s powerful Achaemenid Empire, Zoroaster’s teachings had spread throughout the region and developed into one of the world’s largest religions. Cyrus the Great, who ruled from 559 to 530 BCE and ended the Babylonian captivity of the Jews, may have been influenced by Zoroaster’s teachings. Later Persian rulers, including Darius and Xerxes, worshipped Ahura Mazda.
MAJOR FIGURES
Once prominent and now scarce, Zoroastrian’s most prominent figures begin and end with the founder himself. For that reason, this list also includes the major divine beings within Zoroastrian cosmology.
Zoroaster
The founding prophet of Zoroastrianism, Zoroaster lived near what is now Iran in the sixth century BCE
 or far earlier (scholarly opinion is divided). Despite the polytheistic culture surrounding him, Zoroaster was an early monotheist who taught that Ahura Mazda was the supreme god, ruler of the universe, and source of all good. “Zoroaster” is a Greek version of Zarathustra, the prophet’s name in the ancient Iranian language known as Avestan.
Ahura Mazda
Ahura Mazda is the uncreated supreme god of the Zoroastrian faith. In Avestan, Ahura Mazda
 means “wise lord.” Zoroaster taught that Ahura Mazda, the creator of all the good in the world, was in a constant cosmic battle with Angra Mainyu, the source of evil. Along with the Saoshyant
 (a messianic figure), Ahura Mazda and the Amesha Spenta
 (his spiritual attendants) would eventually defeat Angra Mainyu and usher in a restored world free from evil and chaos, followed by resurrection of the dead and the final judgment.
Angra Mainyu
The deceptive, destructive spirit who has opposed Ahura Mazda since the creation of the world, Angra Mainyu
 (“destructive mind” in Avestan) introduced evil to humanity and attempted to destroy all that is good. Also known as Ahriman, Angra Mainyu is viewed as the chief of the supernatural entities known as daevas
 and dwells in a hellish abyss.
A FAMOUS ZOROASTRIAN
 Beyond Zoroaster himself, perhaps the world’s most famous Zoroastrian was Freddie Mercury (1946–1991), the lead singer of the rock band Queen. Mercury, whose original name was Farrokh Bulsara, was a Parsi. His devout Zoroastrian parents raised him in the religion, and he underwent the navjote
 —the religion’s induction ritual—at eight years old. By most accounts, he identified as a Zoroastrian throughout his life but rarely practiced the faith.
Spenta Mainyu
Spenta Mainyu
 is the “holy spirit” of Ahura Mazda. The earliest Zoroastrians viewed Spenta Mainyu and Angra Mainyu as contrasting brothers, the twin sons of Ahura Mazda. Eventually, beliefs about Spenta Mainyu evolved. Rather than viewing him as a  distinct entity, Zoroastrians began associating him with the divine members of the Amesha Spenta—or with Ahura Mazda himself.
The Amesha Spentas
The Amesha Spentas are a group of divine immortals who accompany Ahura Mazda in the battle against Angra Mainyu. Considered the benevolent “divine sparks” of the creator—all are outflow of his spirit but not to be worshipped apart from him—they each represent a particular concept of goodness toward which humans should strive. These are Asha Vahishta
 (righteousness), Vohu Manah
 (purpose or state of mind), Kshatra Vairya
 (the dominion of the creator), Spenta Armaiti
 (devotion), Haurvatat
 (wholeness or perfection), and Ameretat
 (long life and immortality). These beings were often pitted against opposing daevas.
ATASH DADGAH
 Atash Dadgah is a consecrated fire lit and maintained during fire-temple ceremonies. In some temples, this fire burns continuously. Worshippers pray or recite the Gathas while facing the fire, which represents Ahura Mazda, asha, and the light of goodness within the individual.
Saoshyant
Saoshyant is a prophesied messianic figure, born of a virgin, who will arrive on earth prior to the end of time. He will raise the dead to life, burn away their sins with molten metal, and usher in a new world (Frashokereti
 ) of unity with Ahura Mazda. In Avestan, Saoshyant
 means “one who brings benefit.”
Yazatas and Daevas
Yazata
 is an Avestan term used to represent good divine beings like the Amesha Spentas or the judges of the Chinvat Bridge, who play similar roles as angels in other religions. Ahura Mazda created these beings as emanations of his spirit. Daevas
 are their evil counterparts, demon-like supernatural spirits or false gods who distract humans from good deeds and bring disorder to the world. These were created by Angra Mainyu in the same way Ahura Mazda created the yazata.
The Three Judges
The Three Judges are minor divinities who determine a soul’s worthiness to cross the Chinvat Bridge after death and enter perfect unity with Ahura Mazda. These are Sraosha
 (who represents obedience), Rashnu
 (who represents justice), and Mithra
 (who represents an individual’s kindness and promise-keeping). Mithra may have evolved from beliefs about an ancient, exalted sun god worshipped in Persia prior to Zoroaster.
Vizaresh and Daena
Vizaresh and Deana are divine beings who guide departed souls to their destinations in the afterlife. Those who practice evil deeds are dragged into a hell-like realm of punishment 
 by Vizaresh, a daeva. Those whose deeds are righteous are accompanied by the beautiful Daena into a realm of paradise and reward.
Gayomard
Gayomard is the first human being created by Ahura Mazda and the first to worship him. He died after Angra Mainyu brought death to the created world, but not before fertilizing the ground with his semen, from which a plant bearing the first human couple arose. In Avestan, Gayomard
 means “mortal life.” The modern Persian name for Gayomard is Keyumars.
THE FARAVAHAR
Over the centuries, an ancient image called the Faravahar has become the worldwide symbol for Zoroastrianism. Featuring a human figure over a winged disk, the image may represent the soul, the transcendent glory of Ahura Mazda, or a sort of guardian angel called a fravashi
 . The two curled “streamers” beneath the disk are thought to symbolize good and evil. The human figure has turned away from evil toward goodness.
Carved into structures throughout Egypt and the Middle East, the Faravahar may be more than 4,000 years old. It has long been associated with Persia and Iran. The Pahlavi dynasty—which ruled Iran from 1925 until the Iranian Revolution in 1979—included it in its imperial coat of arms.
MAJOR TENETS
With its focus on free will and a clear distinction between good and evil, Zoroastrianism is a deeply moral religion. Each person is responsible for his or her daily choices from one moment to the next, pursuing good thoughts, good words, and good actions.
Creation
According to the Bundahishn, a work written much later than the Avesta (see here
 ), both Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu existed prior to the creation of the world. Ahura Mazda dwelled in light, while Angra Mainyu lived in darkness. Ahura Mazda created the Amesha Spenta and a perpetually bright world of goodness. From mud he created Gayomard, the primordial man. In response, Angra Mainyu began working to oppose this good world with evil. He created daevas, poisonous creatures, death and illness, the heat of summer, the icy cold of winter, the darkness of night, and an opposite counterpart for each of the six Amesha Spentas. Due to the evil unleashed by Angra Mainyu, Gayomard died—but not before his semen fell to the ground. From this semen grew a plant, and the first human couple emerged from its leaves to dwell in a world of both good and evil.
Deity
Zoroastrianism is monotheistic and recognizes Ahura Mazda as the wise creator and supreme god of the universe. The source of all asha (goodness and truth), he and the forces of light are in a constant cosmic battle against the forces of darkness and chaos. These are led by Angra Mainyu, a destructive, evil spirit who opposes Ahura Mazda.
Scriptures
The holy scriptures of Zoroastrianism are the Avesta, a collection of twenty-one books compiled during the Sassanid Empire (224–651 CE
 )—though the religion’s traditions indicate the Avesta existed centuries before but was destroyed during Alexander the Great’s conquest in 331 BCE
 . The most sacred section of the Avesta is a collection of seventeen hymns called the Gathas, thought to have been written by Zoroaster himself.
Asha and Druj
Asha
 is the fundamental principle of the universe, representing truth, morality, existence, righteousness, and order. Humans have free will and must use it to pursue asha and fight against druj
 —its negative counterpart. Druj
 means “lie” and represents the chaos that results from bad thoughts, words, and deeds. At all times, asha is at risk of being diminished or subverted by druj, but according to the teachings of Zoroaster, asha will be victorious in the end.
The Soul
The individual soul, or urvan
 , is immortal. It exists prior to birth in a state of unity with its guardian angel, or fravashi
 . After birth, it acts in cooperation with the physical body but remains distinct from it. After death, the soul leaves the physical world to reunite with its fravashi in the spiritual realm, prior to crossing the Chinvat Bridge. Souls will be reunited with their resurrected physical bodies at the final judgment (Frashokereti
 ).
Ethics
Ahura Mazda created the human world to ensnare and defeat Angra Mainyu, his enemy. By choosing good thoughts, words, and deeds despite the presence of evil, humans weaken Angra Mainyu. Eventually the presence of good will weaken him so much Ahura Mazda will defeat him permanently. Zoroastrians value good actions like truthfulness, kindness, generosity, forgiveness, and respect. Behaviors like arrogance, revenge, greed, anger, and foul language are druj and belong to the realm of Angra Mainyu.
FREE WILL
 Humans are born good, but Angra Mainyu has brought druj into the world. Therefore, they must constantly choose good over evil. In doing so, they participate alongside Ahura Mazda in the cosmic battle against evil.
Fire
Fire is the pure force that animates the Amesha Spentas, associated with asha. Rather than idols or statues, fire came to symbolize Ahura Mazda himself, who is often equated with the sun. Zoroastrians view fire as a cleansing agent that burns away the darkness of evil, or druj
 . The light of fire is said to illuminate the path of asha.
Death
Because Zoroastrians believe death to be an evil introduced by Angra Mainyu, dead bodies are viewed as unclean. But humans exist in both physical and spiritual components. While the body may die, the soul (urvan
 ) continues to exist. The fate of the soul is determined by the good thoughts, words, and deeds it produced during life on earth.
TOWERS OF SILENCE
Zoroastrians have traditionally believed fire to be sacred and therefore could not use it to burn a deceased body. Water and land were also sacred and the faithful were reluctant to defile these elements with decaying flesh. Instead, they built large circular stone structures called dakhmas . Built on mountainsides and hilltops, these structures were later named “Towers of Silence” by a nineteenth-century British official in India. Zoroastrians expose their dead to the elements on platforms in these towers, to be eaten by vultures and other scavenging birds. Providing sustenance for these creatures was considered a final good deed by the deceased.
Once the bodies were stripped of flesh, attendants would gather the bones into a central well where they would eventually disintegrate into powder. Many Iranian Zoroastrians no longer use dakhmas. In India, the practice has dwindled due to changing attitudes and a precipitous decline in the vulture population. In Mumbai, where the Parsis still prefer to use dakhmas to lay members of their community to rest, Zoroastrians have begun experimenting with solar panels to speed up decomposition and installing ventilation machines atop dakhmas to mask the smell of decay. They’ve even considered breeding vultures in captivity, though that hasn’t come to fruition.
Chinvat Bridge
On the fourth day after death, a soul travels into the spiritual realm, where it will face the Chinvat Bridge, overseen by the three divine judges Sraosha, Rashnu, and Mithra. All souls must attempt to cross this span, and their accumulation of good words, thoughts, and actions will determine the bridge’s width. Those who lived an ethical life will find the bridge wide and welcoming, and will be accompanied across it by Daena, a feminine spirit associated with the conscience. She will guide the soul to Garo Demana
 , the heavenly House of Song.
Individuals judged to be too deceitful or evil will see the bridge narrow to the point they are unable to cross it. They will either plunge over the edge or be dragged by the daeva Vizaresh into the hell-like Drujo Demana
 , the House of Lies.
Final Judgment (Frashokereti)
In addition to the individual judgment of souls at the Chinvat Bridge, Zoroastrianism teaches of a final judgment (Frashokereti
 ) at the end of time when the messianic Saoshyant comes to earth. Creation will be restored to its original uncorrupted state, and humans will be resurrected from the dead for a final judgment. During this time, good will triumph over evil, and deceased souls will be reunited with their resurrected earthly bodies. In these bodies, every individual must wade through a river of molten metal. The righteous will find this river soothing and warm and be unaffected by the heat. Those who practiced evil will find it excruciating as it burns away the last of their wickedness. The river will flow into the House of Lies where it will destroy Angra Mainyu along with the evil, chaos, and lies he brought into the universe. After this point, all of humanity will speak the same language, dwell in peace, shine like the sun, and become immortal. All creation will spend the rest of eternity exalting Ahura Mazda.
The Afterlife
The good will dwell in the presence of Ahura Mazda in the House of Song, a paradise. Those who fall into the House of Lies endure punishment in this temporary hell until their evil behaviors have been corrected, or until a final resurrection at the end of time when all souls will be reunited with Ahura Mazda.
AN IMPACT ON OTHER FAITHS?
Though few Zoroastrians remain in the world today, the impact of this religion—one of the oldest monotheistic religions in human history— may still be flourishing. Mary Boyce, the prominent British scholar of Iranian languages, writes in Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices
 that Zoroastrianism “has probably had more influence on mankind, directly and indirectly, than any other single faith.”
The Babylonian Exile began after the Chaldeans captured Jerusalem in 597 BCE, taking thousands of Jews captive. Most of them were resettled in Babylon before being liberated half a century later by the Persian emperor Cyrus, who may have been a worshipper of Ahura Mazda (inscriptions related to emperors before and after him indisputably indicate Zoroastrianism). By this time, Zoroastrianism was flourishing in the region and may have been the biggest religion in the world.
Both Judaism and Zoroastrianism were monotheistic. But before exposure to the faith of the Babylonians and Persians, the Jews had almost no conception of a dualistic afterlife composed of heaven and hell, or of an eternal soul. The cosmic conflict between God and Satan was virtually nonexistent. In fact, the earliest writings in the Jewish Bible depict Satan as an accuser who sometimes acted on God’s behalf, rather than the malevolent enemy of God who tempts humans to evil. There was no coming day of judgment, no bodily resurrection, and—unlike Zoroastrianism—no messianic prophecy.
But after the exile, these concepts began to appear in the teachings of Jewish prophets and later messianic passages of the Hebrew Bible. By the time Jesus began preaching the coming Kingdom of God in the first century, the concepts of body/soul dualism, a coming apocalypse, and a future resurrection followed by an eternal afterlife had become significant elements of both Judaism and the emerging Christian faith. These developed further in the New Testament and in the first centuries of the Christian church, and were incorporated into the doctrines of Islam as well.
This is where historical dates become very important. The Avesta wasn’t compiled until after the birth of Christ, but Zoroastrian teachings existed centuries before it. Was Zoroaster the first to teach about a devil-like figure, heaven and hell, resurrection, individual judgment, and the eternal soul? If these doctrines didn’t appear in Judaism until the exile, does that mean the Jews borrowed these beliefs from the Zoroastrian Persians? Many Jewish, Christian, and Islamic scholars dispute this theory of doctrinal origins, suggesting instead that Zoroastrianism may itself have been influenced by the preexisting doctrines of Judaism.
If Zoroaster lived and taught around the seventh century BCE, his teachings may have still been evolving at the time of the exile. But if he lived a thousand years earlier, his well-established teachings could have impacted surrounding faiths. If that were the case, Zoroaster may have had more religious influence than any other human in history.
MAJOR TEXTS
Like the Bible of Christianity and the Quran of Islam, the beliefs and sacred teachings of Zoroastrianism are primarily recorded in a single book—in this case, a compilation of texts known as the Avesta.
Avesta
The sacred text of Zoroastrianism and source of its beliefs is known as the Avesta, written in the Avestan language. The first compilation of the Avesta likely originated during the Sassanid Empire (224–651 CE
 ). According to tradition, Zoroaster’s teachings were recorded centuries earlier but destroyed when Alexander the Great conquered Persia. The surviving Avesta includes several fragments alongside the following major sections:
■The Yasna is a liturgical section containing seventeen hymns known as the Gathas. These are believed to have been written by Zoroaster himself and thus are the oldest and most sacred texts of the faith. Zoroastrian priests recite the Yasna during ceremonies.
■The Yashts include twenty-one hymns venerating Ahura Mazda, the Amesha Spentas, and other divine attendants.
■The Vendidad or Videvdat includes purification rules and prayers for defeating evil spirits. It also includes the Zoroastrian creation story.
■The Visperad is another liturgy recited along with the Yasna for special feasts and occasions.
■The Avesta is often accompanied by the Zand, a book of explanations and commentaries written in a later Persian language.
Bundahishn
This text is a retelling of the Zoroastrian creation myth, the earliest parts of which date back to the eighth or ninth century CE
 . It describes how Ahura Mazda, who existed from the very beginning, created the world, the animals, the first man, and fire, only to be opposed by the evil of Angra Mainyu.
THE ZOROASTRIAN CREED: THE FRAVARANE
The Fravarane is a portion of the Yasna, a liturgical section of the Avesta. It is first recited by a young boy or girl during the coming-of-age navjote ceremony, and then recited daily afterward. The lengthy prayer in Avestan includes these translated lines:
I profess myself a Mazda-worshipper, a Zoroastrian, having vowed it and professed it. I pledge myself to the well-thought thought, I pledge myself to the well-spoken word, I pledge myself to the well-done action
—Yasna 12.8
LITURGICAL/CEREMONIAL PRACTICES
The primary goal of Zoroastrianism is to increase asha and decrease druj in the world through the pursuit of good thoughts, words, and deeds. Varieties of rituals—including cleanliness rituals, daily prayers, and worship at home and in fire temples—accompany this pursuit.
Priests
Zoroastrian priests are traditionally male and perform sacrifices, lead public offerings and worship, and facilitate other rituals at a fire temple. These priests (mobed
 ) are often divided between officiating priests (zaotar
 ) 
 and assistant priests (raspi
 ). Etymologically, the word mobed
 (sometimes spelled mobad)
 originates with an ancient Iranian word from which English can trace the word magic
 . In fact, many scholars equate the magi of the Christian birth narrative with ancient Zoroastrian priests.
Fire Temple (Dar-e-Mehr)
The first Zoroastrians worshipped on high, mountainside platforms in the open air. While the Avesta does not mention fire temples, these structures developed to more easily start consecrated fires and keep them burning for ceremonial purposes. Eventually fire temples became the central places of worship for Zoroastrians—and may have been some of the first religious temples in history. The most ancient fire temples were covered by a domed roof and had walls that opened to the outside. There are currently fewer than two hundred fire temples in the world, and only nine (in India and Iran) contain the specially consecrated and purified grade of fire called Atash Behram
 , or “Fire of Victory.”
Religious Gatherings
While most fire temples are open daily for worship, communal worship is not required by the faith or by Zoroastrian scriptures. Most Zoroastrians worship individually in an open-air setting or at home, and only attend fire temples on festival days.
A CEREMONIAL ELIXIR
Haoma is a sacred plant used in the preparation of a Zoroastrian ritual drink. During services at a fire temple, priests mix the crushed twigs of the plant with consecrated water to create an elixir called parahaoma
 , which is then drunk by those attending the ceremony. Early Zoroastrians viewed the plant itself—which had intoxicating effects and may be related to ephedra—as one of the divine emanations of Ahura Mazda. Parahaoma is believed to improve health and fertility, and modern Zoroastrians may give small amounts of the liquid to newborns or those nearing death.
Clothing
Zoroastrian priests wear white garments and a cotton cloth (padan
 ) over their mouths to keep them from breathing impurities on the sacred fire. Lay Zoroastrians wear a special vest-like undergarment called a sudreh
 , which is believed to protect the wearer from evil. It contains a small symbolic pocket to “hold” a person’s good deeds. Zoroastrians also wear a kushti
 , a sacred girdle made of seventy-two threads representing the chapters of the Yasna. It is long enough to encircle a person’s waist three times (symbolizing good thoughts, good words, and good deeds).
Navjote
An intricate Zoroastrian induction ritual, the navjote takes place when a boy or girl has reached the age of personal responsibility, traditionally between the ages of fourteen and fifteen. Today, it may take place for children as young as seven years old. Along with a confession of faith, this ceremony marks the first time the child wears the sacred sudreh and kushti.
SEVEN: THE HOLY NUMBER
 Seven is a holy number in Zoroastrianism. Ahura Mazda and his Amesha Spentas represent seven facets of goodness or divinity, and Zoroaster preached there were seven interconnected creations: fire, water, earth, sky, plants, animals, and humankind.
Padyab
This is a water-based purification ritual performed before prayers, temple visits, or the Nirang-i Kushti. While reciting a prayer invoking asha, the adherent washes the exposed parts of his or her body—the hands, face, and feet—before drying them with a clean towel.
Nirang-i Kushti
A rite of cleanliness performed by both men and women in preparation for prayer throughout the day, the Nirang-i Kushti
 involves tying the kushti
 , or sacred girdle, with specific motions while reciting a prayer of contrition. The Zoroastrian raises the kushti to his or her forehead upon naming Ahura Mazda and tugs it violently while naming Angra Mainyu. Interrupting an individual performing this ritual is forbidden.
Marriage Rituals
On the wedding day, after both the bride and groom have taken sacred baths, a ceremony takes place at the home of the bride. Both the bride and groom sit facing each other, separated by a cloth curtain, with candles lit on either side of them. A priest encircles them with a cloth or string while reciting scriptures, then fastens their right hands together below the curtain in a position called hathevaro
 , using a knot made of seven twists, while reciting a prayer seven times. The bride and groom hold rice in their left hands and shower each other with it after the seventh prayer. At this point, the curtain between the couple drops and their hands are untied.
Prohibitions
Zoroastrians should avoid bad thoughts, words, and deeds, including anger, jealousy, greed, laziness, adultery, abusive language, breaking promises, lies, revenge, and apostasy. Once committed, evil deeds must be confessed and atoned for with prayer and Nirang-i Kushti.
Prayer
Zoroastrians offer five obligatory daily prayers, known as farziyat
 , during the day. These hymns are recited or sung in Avestan after a ritual cleansing, and are usually said facing a fire or the sun—a reminder of Ahura Mazda. The purpose of most prayers is to call upon Ahura Mazda for help in pursuing good and defeating evil.
Music
Most prayers or recitations of the sacred hymns of the Gathas are accompanied by music, including bells and tambourines used in fire-temple ceremonies. However, due to the overall decline of Zoroastrianism over the centuries, many of the ancient melodies associated with its hymns have been lost.
FESTIVALS AND HOLY DAYS
Throughout the history of the faith, the traditional twelve-month Zoroastrian calendar has been adjusted multiple times, causing controversy within the community. As a result, there are now three different calendars used by various groups. The oldest calendars, the Qadimi and Shahanshahi, did not incorporate leap years, causing festival days to shift over the centuries. The newer Fasli calendar includes a leap day and remains synchronized with the seasons. Festival dates are according to the Fasli calendar.
NAW-RUZ
Naw-Ruz is the Zoroastrian New Year’s Day, celebrated in March on the day of the spring equinox. On this day, families arrange a haft-seen
 , or seven items beginning with the letter S (seen
 ) from the Persian alphabet. These items have varied over the years, but often include sharab
 (wine), shakar
 (sugar), shir
 (milk), shireh
 (syrup), shahd
 (honey), shirini
 (candy), and shir-berenj
 (rice pudding).
PATETI
Pateti is the Zoroastrian New Year’s Eve. Formally a day of introspection, pateti
 is a Persian word meaning “repentance.” Before transforming into a celebration on the last day of the calendar year, Pateti was a day for the faithful to repent of their bad thoughts, words, or deeds and devote the coming year to good.
KHORDAD SAL
A day of celebration marking the traditional birthday of Zoroaster, Khordad Sal is observed right after the start of the new year (March).
ZARTOSHT NO-DISO
A day of mourning on the anniversary of Zoroaster’s death, this holy day is usually observed on December 26. Adherents attend services at the fire temple.
GAHAMBARS
These obligatory celebrations are related to the changing of the seasons and include a religious ceremony followed by a feast. Each was traditionally celebrated over a five-day period, though modern observances tend to be limited to the last day of the festival. The Gahambars were first mentioned in the Avesta and include the following:
•
 Maidyozarem Gahambar: A mid-spring festival in late April or early May
•
 Maidyoshahem Gahambar: A midsummer festival in late June or early July
•
 Paitishahem Gahambar: A harvest festival in September
•
 Ayathrem Gahambar: An end-of-autumn festival in October
•
 Maidyarem Gahambar: A midyear festival, originally observed on the winter solstice, now around the start of the Western New Year
•
 Hamaspathmaidyem Gahambar :
 A ten-day festival in March commemorating departed souls
NAME-DAY FEASTS
The Zoroastrian calendar also includes eleven special feasts dedicated to yazatas (including the Amesha Spentas) and four feasts dedicated to Ahura Mazda. On each of these occasions, Zoroastrians attend a worship service.
DIVISIONS
The small number of Zoroastrians still practicing in modern times are primarily divided into geographical communities. Because these communities diverged from each other, they developed a few differing cultural practices over time. However, the primary distinctions between them are variations in the Zoroastrian calendar and timing of religious festivals.
Parsis
The Parsis are Indian Zoroastrians descended from the Persians who fled to India over several centuries to avoid persecution and forced conversion after the fall of the Sassanid Empire to Islam in the seventh century CE
 . Clustered around Mumbai, the Parsis found success as merchants and, later, became wealthy owners and operators of large industries.
Gabars
A small Zoroastrian community in Iran, Gabars descended from the Zoroastrians who remained in Persia. This group faces persecution today and has lived as minority outcasts since the defeat of the Sassanid Empire.
Iranis
Iranis are Zoroastrians from Iran who began migrating to India more recently that the Parsis, in the nineteenth century. Like the Parsis, they are concentrated around Mumbai.
TO BE ZOROASTRIAN
 “On the three excellent things be never intent, namely, good thoughts, good words, and good deeds.” —Vendidad 18.17
GOOD OR EVIL
The simple pursuit of the Zoroastrian religion—good thoughts, good words, good deeds—promotes practical individual ethics that benefit the larger society. The faith has a reputation as one of joyful feasts and celebrations and is centered on community. Along with its seasonal festivals, Zoroastrianism’s scriptures praise the natural world and have resulted in a strong ecological focus and respect for nature. Of Zoroaster’s seven creations, Ahura Mazda tasked humanity with caring for the other six (fire, water, earth, sky, plants, and animals). For this reason, sacrificial offerings of animals have never been part of the faith.
The small number of modern Zoroastrians have very little influence on today’s world. It’s a faith that does not proselytize or promote conversion, which means its population is linked to the survival of the persecuted Zoroastrian communities in Iran and the small Parsi and Irani communities in India. While this may not qualify as a “negative impact” on the world, it is a feature of the religion that may result in its gradual disappearance. Then again, if ancient Zoroastrianism truly did influence significant elements of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (see here
 ), its impact—both positive and negative—may last as long as humans practice those faiths.
INTO THE FUTURE
Though it has existed for thousands of years— centuries longer than Christianity and Islam, and possibly as long as or longer than Judaism— Zoroastrianism has almost disappeared in today’s society. It may have only a few hundred thousand adherents left in the world. Conversion to Zoroastrianism is rare, and its future depends almost exclusively on the future of the Parsi and Irani people of India, as well as the few thousand Zoroastrians remaining in Iran. As long as these ethnic groups survive, Zoroastrianism will live on. If their population declines, Zoroastrianism will survive only to the degree to which it influenced other world religions.FURTHER READING
